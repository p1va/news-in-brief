**ASIA IN BRIEF**

I am your host Amelia, today is Friday 12, and this is 'Asia in Brief'. Today's episode is brought to you by DeepSeek-V3.2-Special, let's get into it!

**"Dissolution Amid Devastation"**  
Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul dissolved parliament Friday, calling early elections for early next year. The move comes as Thai and Cambodian forces exchange fire for a sixth day along their disputed border. Anutin insists the war effort will continue unabated, but the dissolution is seen as a bid to rally nationalist support amid mounting casualties. Thailand claims Cambodia is using “kamikaze” drones supplied by foreign actors, while Phnom Penh says Thai airstrikes have killed at least 11 civilians and displaced nearly 200,000. The conflict is testing ASEAN unity and risks drawing in external powers.

**"Rising Sun, Rising Rates"**  
The Bank of Japan is set to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a year, marking a decisive shift from its long‑standing ultra‑loose monetary policy. With inflation now above target, the BOJ is expected to lift its benchmark rate, currently at 0.25%, at its meeting next week. The move contrasts with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s recent rate cuts and could strengthen the yen, easing import costs but potentially triggering capital outflows from emerging Asia. Investors will watch for any signal of further tightening.

**"Silicon Curtain"**  
The United States has launched a new international pact to secure supply chains for artificial intelligence, aiming to reduce dependence on China. The coalition, expected to include key Asian allies such as Japan and South Korea, will focus on semiconductors, critical minerals, and AI infrastructure. This is the latest move in Washington’s tech decoupling strategy and comes as Beijing orders state‑owned data centers to use domestic chips. Analysts warn the bifurcation will force countries to choose sides, reshaping global tech trade and accelerating a new cold war in innovation.

**"Hospital Under Fire"**  
A Myanmar military airstrike hit a hospital in a rebel‑controlled area on Friday, killing at least 34 people and injuring 80, according to local reports. The attack is one of the deadliest on civilian infrastructure since the 2021 coup, underscoring the junta’s increasing reliance on air power as it loses ground to ethnic rebels. With China and Russia blocking meaningful U.N. action, there is little hope for accountability, and the humanitarian crisis continues to deepen.

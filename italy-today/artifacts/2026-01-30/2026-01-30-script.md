Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", today is Friday, January 30th, and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

We begin with the blitz.

The Italian job market delivers a surprise jolt of optimism, with *Il Sole Ventiquattro Ore* reporting unemployment has fallen to 5.6%, the lowest figure since 2004, a number the government will surely parade all weekend. In Sicily, the Niscemi landslide scandal deepens; *Corriere della Sera* reveals a 2022 dossier explicitly warned of "very high risk" in the exact spot that collapsed, proving the emergency was foretold but ignored. Following up on the security measures discussed yesterday, Turin is bracing for impact as the "Askatasuna" social center refuses the Prefect's mediation, with *La Stampa* warning of three separate marches converging on the city center tomorrow. On the international front, *Il Fatto Quotidiano* reports that Donald Trump is dusting off the "Italygate" conspiracy theory, alleging Italian satellites were used to rig the 2020 US election—a headache Rome really didn't need. And finally, students take note: the Ministry has confirmed that Latin is back for the Classical lyceum and Mathematics for the Scientific track in the 2026 Maturità exams.

But we must open with the heavy artillery firing inside the Palace of Justice.

The inauguration of the Judicial Year is usually a ceremony of ermine robes, polite applause, and dry statistics. Today, however, it turned into an open battlefield between the executive branch and the judiciary. The spark was the government's proposed referendum on the separation of careers—splitting judges from prosecutors. The First President of the Court of Cassation, Pasquale D’Ascola, issued a grave warning from the podium, defining the current unity of the judiciary as a "cornerstone" of the constitutional system and implying that the reform threatens judicial independence.

The government’s response was immediate and unusually aggressive. Justice Minister Carlo Nordio, sitting in the same room, took the microphone and declared it "blasphemous"—his exact word—to suggest that the government’s reform undermines independence. This is a semantic escalation that signals a total breakdown working relationship. *La Repubblica* and the *Mediaset* papers are treating this like two different realities. The center-left press frames D’Ascola’s speech as a desperate defense of the Constitution against a hostile takeover. *Il Giornale* and *Libero*, conversely, frame Nordio’s "blasphemy" comment as a righteous crusade against a caste of untouchables who refuse to be reformed.

The stakes here are structural. This isn't just bickering; it is the prelude to a referendum that could fundamentally rewrite the balance of power in Italy. As *Il Fatto Quotidiano* notes with its usual prosecutorial zeal, if the separation of careers passes—and the polls suggest it might—the Italian judiciary will lose its monolithic power structure. The "war of the robes" isn't coming; it is already here, and it is being fought on live television in front of the Head of State.

Moving from the courtroom to the Parliament, the political temperature reached a boiling point over who is allowed inside the "Temple of Democracy."

Chaos erupted at Montecitorio this morning when a League deputy, Domenico Furgiuele, attempted to host a press conference featuring CasaPound, the neo-fascist movement, to present a proposal on "Remigration." The mere presence of CasaPound inside the Chamber triggered a physical and vocal revolt from the opposition. MPs from the Democratic Party, Five Star Movement, and the Green-Left Alliance physically occupied the press room, waving copies of the Constitution and singing "Bella Ciao" until the event was cancelled for "public order reasons."

The narrative split here is sharp and reveals the fragility of the current political discourse. *La Stampa* and *Fanpage* describe the attempted conference as an institutional obscenity, a legitimization of the far-right within the halls of Parliament. They highlight the "Remigration" topic as a direct import of xenophobic rhetoric. On the flip side, *Libero* and *La Verità* are attacking the Left’s reaction as illiberal, arguing that blocking a press conference—even one by extremists—is an act of censorship, with *Il Giornale* asking why the Left is allowed to dictate who speaks in a public building. It is a classic Italian stalemate: the Right tests the boundaries of historical memory, the Left mobilizes the resistance, and the actual business of legislating grinds to a halt amidst shouting matches.

Meanwhile, moving to the engine room of the economy, there is a changing of the guard that is far more consequential than the shouting in Parliament.

While the unemployment numbers are good, the institutions managing the money are shifting. *Il Sole Ventiquattro Ore* reports that Luigi Federico Signorini is stepping down as Director General of the Bank of Italy for personal reasons. He will be replaced by Paolo Angelini. This might seem like boring bureaucratic shuffling, but in Rome, personnel is policy. Signorini was a pillar of the old guard; his exit marks another step in the slow potential reshaping of Italy's independent authorities. With the economy showing signs of life—employment is up—the struggle now is over who controls the levers of stability.

But before we go, let's turn to the nightmare of every Italian high school student.

The Ministry of Education has released the subjects for the 2026 "Maturità" exams, and there is no mercy this year. As reported by *Corriere della Sera*, the pendulum has swung back to tradition. Students at the *Liceo Classico* will face a version of Latin—the subject they dread most—while the *Scientifico* gets hit with Mathematics. But the real sting is in the oral exam: Minister Valditara has tweaked the rules so that the interview will cover four specific disciplines, making it much harder to "wing it." It is a clear signal that the era of the "light" exam, a hangover from the pandemic years, is officially over. The "notti prima degli esami" this June are going to be very long indeed.

I will see you tomorrow.

[energetic] Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", I am your host Amelia, Today is Thursday, January 01 and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

[pause]

[somber] The new year has begun with a horrific tragedy just across the border that has left Italy holding its breath. **Corriere Della Sera** and **La Repubblica** are devoting their entire front pages to the catastrophe in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, where a fire in a popular nightclub has killed at least 47 people and injured over 115. The victims are overwhelmingly young, and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani has confirmed that at least 19 Italians are currently among the hospitalized or missing.

[newscaster] The details emerging are nightmarish. **Libero** and **La Stampa** report that the blaze at the "Le Constellation" bar was triggered by something as banal as sparklers on champagne bottles, which ignited the soundproofing on the ceiling. **Il Giornale** describes a "flashover" effect—a sudden, explosive spread of fire—noting that the venue reportedly became a trap with only one narrow exit available. While the Swiss authorities begin their investigation, the Italian press is filled with the desperate appeals of parents, including a mother cited by **Fanpage** pleading for news of her missing 16-year-old son.

[newscaster] Meanwhile, within our own borders, the night of San Silvestro brought its customary, senseless "bulletin of war." **ANSA** reports that the celebrations left one person dead in Rome and 283 injured across the peninsula, a grim increase compared to last year. The toll on minors is particularly heavy.

[somber] **Fanpage** and **Adnkronos** highlight the gruesome nature of these accidents, reporting on a 12-year-old in Milan who lost a hand, and a 14-year-old in Brescia who lost four fingers. Despite the bans and the mayors' ordinances that **Il Fatto Quotidiano** notes were largely ignored, the cultural addiction to high-explosive celebrations continues to overwhelm emergency rooms every January 1st.

[pause]

[cynical] Turning from the emergency rooms to the government gazette, the first political hangover of 2026 is already throbbing. **Il Sole Ventiquattro Ore** reveals that the much-anticipated "Milleproroghe" decree—the traditional basket of deadline extensions—was approved with a glaring omission: the hiring bonuses for women and under-35s have vanished.

[newscaster] The reaction splits exactly down partisan lines. **La Repubblica** and **Fanpage** frame this as a betrayal, pointing out that despite the government's rhetoric on youth employment, the funds simply weren't allocated. On the defensive side, **Il Giornale** and government sources insist this is merely a technical stumble, promising that the measure will be "recovered" through a parliamentary amendment in the coming weeks. However, combined with the hikes in tolls, cigarettes, and diesel that **La Stampa** confirms kicked in this morning, it is a cold economic shower to start the year.

[pause]

[energetic] But before we go, here is a quick scan of the rest of the newsstand.

[newscaster] First, a small win for Italian exports from across the Atlantic. **Libero** reports that Donald Trump has decided to cut tariffs on Italian pasta, a move celebrated by Minister Lollobrigida as a sign of "respect," even as the US President kept drapes drawn on other trade concessions.

[newscaster] Also, the country tuned in en masse for the President. **Corriere Della Sera** notes that nearly 11 million Italians watched Sergio Mattarella’s end-of-year address last night, a ratings smash that confirms the Head of State remains the most unifying figure in the republic.

[somber] And finally, a historic moment in New York City with an Italian echo. **ANSA** covers the swearing-in of Zohran Mamdani as Mayor, noting he took his oath on the Quran, marking a significant cultural shift in the American metropolis.

[newscaster] That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.

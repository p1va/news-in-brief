Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", today is Sunday 25 and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

Let’s get straight to the pulse of the nation. The tragedy in Anguillara has spiraled into horror as the parents of Claudio Carlomagno—the man who confessed to killing his wife—were found dead by suicide, crushed, as **Corriere della Sera** reports, by a mix of shame and social media pillorying. On the diplomatic calendar, today marks ten years since the disappearance of Giulio Regeni; **La Repubblica** highlights President Mattarella’s letter to the parents, demanding "full light on responsibilities"—a pointed message to Cairo that the wound remains open. In the Mediterranean, the death toll rises: **La Stampa** reports a shipwreck with 50 dead and a staggering 380 dispersed over the last ten days, a silence that screams louder than the political rhetoric. Meanwhile, inside the coalition, Matteo Salvini issues a thinly veiled threat to General Vannacci: "Whoever leaves the League ends up in nothing." And finally, a look East: **Il Sole 24 Ore** and **Il Messaggero** note the arrival of the Chinese auto giant Geely with its bestselling SUV, signaling that while politicians debate tariffs, the market is already shifting.

But we begin with the diplomatic frost settling over the Alps. Following our report yesterday on the recall of the Italian Ambassador to Switzerland, the standoff over the Crans-Montana tragedy has shifted from political posturing to a cold institutional wall. 

The figure at the center of the storm is Béatrice Pilloud, the Prosecutor General of Valais. **Libero** paints a portrait of a stoic, rigid magistrate who wakes up at 4:30 AM and refuses to blink. Her statement is blunt: she will not yield to pressure from Rome regarding the release on bail of Jacques Moretti, the nightclub owner. While the Italian government views the bail as an insult to the six Italian victims, Pilloud reminded the Ambassador to direct his complaints to politicians, not the judiciary.

The narrative divide in the Italian press is stark. On the Right, **Il Giornale** and **La Verità** continue to hammer the "scandal" angle, accusing the Swiss system of having holes that money can fill, suggesting that Moretti’s bail was paid by a "wealthy friend" to protect a network of interests. They are rallying around Meloni’s decision to flex diplomatic muscle. However, the business establishment is getting nervous. **La Stampa** and **Il Sole 24 Ore** are warning that escalating a judicial disagreement into a full-blown diplomatic rift with a key economic partner like Switzerland is a high-risk gamble. They highlight the response from Swiss President Guy Parmelin, who lectured Rome on the separation of powers. The takeaway is that Meloni is caught between the need to show strength to her domestic base and the reality that she cannot force a Swiss prosecutor to change the law.

Moving from the mountains to the grinding gears of the government coalition, the internal friction is heating up. The issue is identity, and the catalyst is Tommy Robinson.

**La Repubblica** and **Il Fatto Quotidiano** are feasting on the discord caused by Matteo Salvini hosting the British far-right extremist at the Ministry of Transport. But the real news isn't the guest; it's the reaction from within the majority. Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, usually the diplomat, drew a hard line in **Corriere della Sera**, stating that Robinson is "incompatible with our values." This has emboldened the centrist opposition, with Carlo Calenda praising Tajani’s stance.

Salvini is fighting a war on two fronts. While fending off Tajani in the center, he is trying to secure his right flank against General Roberto Vannacci, the controversial MEP elected on the League’s ticket who is rumored to be starting his own party. **Il Giornale** reports Salvini’s warning shot delivered from a stage in Abruzzo: "Whoever leaves the League ends up in nothing." It is a clear message to the General: you are famous because of my symbol, do not mistake your popularity for political autonomy. The synthesis here is a government struggling to define where the "Right" ends and the "Far Right" begins, a distinction that is becoming increasingly expensive for Italy's international reputation.

Turning to the geopolitical stage, the "friendship" with the incoming Trump administration is hitting its first significant speed bump, and it involves military honor.

**Libero** and **Il Giornale**—usually the first to cheer for Trump—are visibly stung by the President-elect's comments that NATO allies "stayed in the rear" during the Afghanistan conflict. For Italy, which lost 53 soldiers and had over 700 wounded, this is an open wound. Prime Minister Meloni issued a formal rebuke, stating that "friendship needs respect." **La Verità** frames this as a necessary correction, noting that Italy commanded the Western sector and was engaged in heavy combat, not rear-guard duties.

**La Repubblica** analyzes this with a touch of cynicism, suggesting that Meloni is discovering the hard limits of her Atlanticist alignment. The takeaway is harsh but clear: Trump’s "America First" does not have a "Best Friends" exemption clause, and Rome is realizing that historical loyalty might not buy the leverage they hoped for in the new Washington.

But before we go, a moment of history in the making within the Vatican walls. **AGI** reports that after nearly nine months of darkness following the transition, the mosaic medallion of the new Pontiff has finally been illuminated in the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls. The portrait of Pope Leo XIV, elected last May, now shines alongside his 266 predecessors. It is a centuries-old tradition: only the reigning Pope’s face is lit, while the others fade into the shadows of the nave. A bright circle of gold in the Roman gloom, signaling that the machine of the Church, much like the country surrounding it, keeps turning regardless of the noise outside.

That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.

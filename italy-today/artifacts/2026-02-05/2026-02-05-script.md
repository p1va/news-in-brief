Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", today is Thursday 05 and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

We begin with the blitz. In Milan, President Sergio Mattarella has officially inaugurated the Olympic spirit at the Athletes' Village, reminding the Italian team that "the first competition is against one's own limits," a message of unity delivered just hours before the games begin. Meanwhile, tragedy strikes again in the Alps: an avalanche in Solda, Alto Adige, has claimed the lives of two ski mountaineers, sparking renewed debates on mountain safety protocols amidst unstable weather conditions. In the courts, the endless "Garlasco mystery" takes a surreal turn; *La Repubblica* reports that the former lawyer of the new suspect, Andrea Sempio, has been indicted for defamation against the legal team of Alberto Stasi, dragging a twenty-year-old murder case back into the spotlight. On the geopolitical front, tension is spiking in the Middle East, with *Il Giornale* reporting a "five-point plan" being brokered by Qatar and Turkey to establish a non-aggression pact between the US and Iran, involving strict limits on ballistic missiles. Finally, in the markets, Bitcoin has shed half its value from last year's records, a volatility that *La Stampa* notes is shaking the confidence of the crypto-faithful just as the EU moves toward tighter regulation.

But the story driving the legislative agenda is the government’s crackdown on dissent, which has finally cleared the Council of Ministers after a tug-of-war with the Quirinale.

The so-called "Security Decree" has been approved, but not without significant tactical adjustments. Yesterday, we reported that President Mattarella had tapped the brakes on the bill, concerned about the constitutionality of "preventive detention"—allowing police to hold protesters considered dangerous for up to 24 hours without a judge's order. Today, the government found a workaround. As detailed by *Il Fatto Quotidiano*, the compromise allows for a "preventive stop" of 12 hours, but with a critical caveat: the Public Prosecutor must be immediately notified and has the power to order the immediate release of the detainee if the conditions aren't met. It is a procedural safety valve inserted to keep the legislation within constitutional guardrails while still allowing the Right to claim a victory for law and order.

The narrative divide is stark. *Il Giornale* and *Libero* are celebrating the measure as a necessary shield against "urban warfare," highlighting new penalties for road blockades and a ban on carrying weapons—specifically aimed at minors, with fines extending to their parents. Justice Minister Nordio, quoted in *La Stampa*, raised the stakes dramatically, justifying the harsh measures by stating the government wants to "avoid a return to the Red Brigades." On the other side of the aisle, *La Repubblica* and *Fanpage* frame this as the crystallization of a "Police State," where the "Gandhi norm"—criminalizing passive resistance like road blocks—transforms peaceful protest into a penal offense. The bill now heads to Parliament, where the opposition has vowed to build barricades of their own.

Moving from the halls of Rome to the diplomatic minefield of the Winter Games, the Olympics are proving to be as much about geopolitical posturing as athletic prowess.

While the athletes prep for the slopes, a high-stakes diplomatic snub is brewing in the VIP box. *La Repubblica* reports that French President Emmanuel Macron is "almost certain" to skip the opening ceremony at San Siro. The reason is purely political: strict protocol dictates seating by alphabetical order of the hosting nations for the next games. This would place Macron, representing the 2030 French Alps games, directly next to U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance, representing the 2034 Salt Lake City games. According to reports, the French President has no desire to be photographed shoulder-to-shoulder with the isolationist American VP, especially given the current icy relations between Washington and Brussels. *Libero* adds that Spanish Premier Pedro Sanchez might also pull out, citing his refusal to attend events with Israeli representatives. It seems the "Olympic Truce" stops at the seating chart.

Turning to the engine room of the Italian state, the hunt for revenue has produced some staggering numbers.

*Il Sole 24 Ore* leads with a report that is music to the Treasury's ears but a nightmare for the black market: the Revenue Agency has identified 200,000 "total evaders"—entities that are completely unknown to the taxman yet active in the economy. Of these, 86,000 are absolute "ghosts." The state is preparing a massive offensive for 2026, with 2.4 million compliance letters ready to be mailed out. While the government frames this as a matter of fairness, *La Stampa* notes the macroeconomic implication: the Parliamentary Budget Office estimates that a structural reduction in evasion could lower Italy's debt-to-GDP ratio by 4 to 6 points. In a country desperate for fiscal breathing room, hunting ghosts has become the most profitable industry in town.

But before we go, we head to the small town of Porto Viro near Rovigo for a lesson in the power of a good mascot.

In a political landscape dominated by generals and technocrats, *La Stampa* brings us the story of a mayor whose victory was secured by "man's best friend." During the recount of a tight local election, three ballots were contested because voters had written the name "Spike" on them instead of the candidate's name. Spike happens to be the mayor's dog, who accompanied him everywhere during the campaign. The Council of State has now ruled that those votes are valid, arguing that the voters' intent was clear, effectively ruling that in Italy, a vote for the dog is a vote for the master. It’s a rare instance where going to the dogs was actually a winning strategy.

I will see you tomorrow.

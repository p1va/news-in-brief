[energetic] Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", I am your host Amelia, Today is Wednesday, December 31, and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

[newscaster] As the clocks count down to 2026, the country is preparing for its most sacred secular ritual: the President’s end-of-year address. Tonight, Sergio Mattarella will enter the living rooms of millions of Italians. According to **Corriere Della Sera**, the speech is expected to be a call for "social cohesion," with a specific focus on the anxieties of the younger generation and an appeal for peace in a world actively at war. It is the steady, institutional anchor the country expects before the corks pop.

[cynical] However, hours before the President speaks, the ghost of populism past has decided to crash the party. **La Repubblica** and **Il Fatto Quotidiano** report that Beppe Grillo, the founder of the Five Star Movement, has emerged from his blog with a ferocious "counter-message." In a post that **Il Giornale** dismisses as the ranting of a sidelined leader, Grillo describes the current political class as "zombies haunting the palaces of power" and attacks the judiciary for using justice as a "political club." While **Adnkronos** notes the timing is likely a distraction from the internal fracturing of his own movement, it sets up a jarring contrast for New Year's Eve: the polite institutional hope of the Quirinale versus the angry, anti-establishment cynicism of the grillini base.

[newscaster] Following up on yesterday’s report regarding the investigation into TV host Alfonso Signorini, the scandal has moved from legal theory to public accusation. The influencer Antonio Medugno has broken his silence. **Fanpage** and **La Repubblica** give prominence to his statements today, where he claims he was "manipulated" by his manager into visiting Signorini’s home, though he explicitly denies that sexual intercourse took place.

[cynical] The media battle lines are hardening. **Il Fatto Quotidiano** frames this as a system of exploitation within the entertainment industry, using words like "shame" and "fear." Conversely, the center-right press is mounting a skepticism defense. **Libero** and **Il Giornale** amplify Medugno's admission that no sex occurred, suggesting the "sexual violence" charge might be overblown, while casting the accuser as someone "naive" who walked into a situation he didn't understand. The investigation is ongoing, but the court of public opinion is already delivering its verdict on the "King of Gossip."

[newscaster] Moving from the tabloids to the pocketbook, the arrival of 2026 brings a stinging reality check for drivers. **Il Sole Ventiquattro Ore** confirms that starting tomorrow morning, the excise duties on diesel fuel will rise, a move the government describes as an "alignment" but which **La Stampa** characterizes as a tax hike that will ripple through the logistics sector.

[cynical] It is a classic bad news burial on New Year's Eve. While **Il Giornale** defends the budget package by pointing to the concomitant tax cuts for low earners, **La Repubblica** lists a "barrage" of increases waiting in January, including higher motorway tolls and cigarette prices. The takeaway is clear: enjoy the prosecco tonight, because the cost of living is clocking in early tomorrow morning.

[energetic] But before we go, here is a quick scan of the rest of the newsstand.

[somber] First, a warning for your New Year's dinner. **Corriere Della Sera** reports a tragedy in Campobasso, where a mother and daughter have died, and the father is hospitalized, due to suspected food poisoning. Authorities have seized 19 different food items, including mushrooms and polenta, sparking a regional alert.

[newscaster] Also, the war of words continues in the east. **Adnkronos** juxtaposes two chilling new year messages: Russian President Vladimir Putin declaring "We believe in victory," while Ukrainian President Zelensky counters with "We believe in peace."

[energetic] And finally, despite the tensions, the party goes on. **La Stampa** reports that security is tight across major cities, with metal detectors and limited capacity in public squares from Turin to Naples, as Italy prepares to welcome 2026.

[newscaster] That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.

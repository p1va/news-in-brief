[energetic] Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", I am your host Amelia, Today is Saturday 17 and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

[pause]

[somber] We begin with a tragic update to yesterday’s report from Liguria, where the violence in a La Spezia classroom has turned into a homicide investigation. Youssef, the 18-year-old student stabbed during a lesson, has died from his injuries. The aggressor, a 19-year-old classmate, has confessed, telling prosecutors the attack was motivated by jealousy over a girl and a photograph. What began as a schoolyard dispute has now triggered a furious national debate on youth violence and security.

[newscaster] The political reaction was instantaneous and polarized. Education Minister Giuseppe Valditara called the event "extremely grave," ordering an immediate inspection of the school. [cynical] However, the Right is already pivoting from grief to policy. **Il Giornale** and **Libero** are amplifying Deputy Premier Matteo Salvini’s call for a ban on the sale of "bladed weapons" to minors, framing this not as a tragedy of passion, but as a failure of law and order. **La Verità** takes a harder line, linking the violence to cultural backgrounds, while **La Repubblica** focuses on the "social malaise" of a generation incapable of managing emotions. The takeaway is bleak: a student is dead, and the government is preparing to turn school discipline into a matter of national security.

[cynical] Following up on the scandal at the Privacy Guarantor’s office, the cracks in the institution are widening. **Il Fatto Quotidiano** reports that board member Guido Scorza has resigned, urging his colleagues to do the same following the corruption probe involving luxury expenses and personal perks. However, the rest of the board is digging in. **Il Giornale** leads with a defiant headline: "The Guarantor Resists," detailing how the remaining members claim the expenses were legitimate or will be reimbursed. The press is ruthless today: **Il Sole 24 Ore** highlights a collapse in trust between the administration and the Bank of Italy, suggesting that while the board fights for its survival, the actual function of the agency is grinding to a halt.

[newscaster] Turning our eyes abroad, a storm is brewing over the Atlantic. **Corriere Della Sera** reports that Donald Trump has escalated his rhetoric regarding Greenland, threatening 10% tariffs on European nations that send troops to the island. While **La Verità** mocks the European military presence there as negligible, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is treading carefully. Speaking from Tokyo, she stated that any presence in Greenland must be discussed within the NATO framework, trying to avoid a direct diplomatic clash with the incoming US administration. Meanwhile, former Premier Mario Draghi, receiving the Charlemagne Prize, warned starkly that "Europe has more enemies than ever," urging the continent to toughen up economically and militarily.

[energetic] But before we go, here is a quick scan of the rest of the newsstand.

[somber] First, the Italian business and sports world is mourning Rocco Commisso. **Il Post** and **La Repubblica** confirm the death of the Fiorentina President and media tycoon at age 76 after a long illness. He is being remembered today not just for football, but as a classic Italian-American success story.

[newscaster] Also, **Il Sole 24 Ore** drops a heavy statistic on the economy of honesty. In a review of ISEE welfare declarations, authorities discovered 1.7 million "unfaithful" declarations—fraudulent claims involving false income or residency data to access state benefits.

[cynical] And finally, a moment of dark comedy from **Il Fatto Quotidiano**. Iconic comedian Massimo Boldi has been unceremoniously removed from the list of Olympic torchbearers for the upcoming Milano-Cortina games. The reason? An interview where he claimed his only sporting disciplines were "women and aperitivi." The Olympic committee was not amused.

[newscaster] That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.

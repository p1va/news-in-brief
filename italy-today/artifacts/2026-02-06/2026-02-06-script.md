Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", today is Friday 06 and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

We begin with the blitz. In Moscow, the shadow war has reached the capital's doorstep; the Vice Chief of Russian Military Intelligence, Major General Vladimir Alekseyev, has been shot and critically wounded in an assassination attempt, a strike that *La Repubblica* calls a "perfect crime" destabilizing the Kremlin's security apparatus. Closer to home, the industrial pride of Italy has taken a severe beating; Stellantis stock has crashed by nearly 25% in Milan, wiping out billions in value after announcing a dividend suspension and massive costs linked to the electric transition. In the halls of Parliament, the League is bleeding from the right flank; two MPs have defected to join General Roberto Vannacci’s new political movement, "Futuro Nazionale," signaling the start of a dangerous fragmentation within the government coalition. Across the Atlantic, a cultural firestorm has erupted after Donald Trump posted—and then deleted—a racist AI video depicting the Obamas, a move *La Stampa* describes as "institutional delirium." Finally, the "Justice War" escalates, as the Court of Cassation has officially greenlit the new referendum question on separating careers in the judiciary, backed by 500,000 signatures, setting the stage for a spring showdown at the ballot box.

But the eyes of the world are fixed on Milan tonight, where the Winter Olympics are set to begin not just with a torch, but with a masterclass in populism and high-wire diplomacy.

The opening ceremony at San Siro is the main event, but the real show started hours earlier on the city’s rails. In a move calculated to puncture the narrative of elitism often surrounding the games, President Sergio Mattarella arrived at the stadium not in a motorcade, but aboard a historic Milanese tram, driven by none other than MotoGP legend Valentino Rossi. *Corriere della Sera* frames this as a brilliant stroke of "institutional normalcy," a symbolic hug to a city under siege by construction sites and traffic. However, the unity in the tram contrasts sharply with the tension in the VIP box. While Mattarella plays the benevolent grandfather of the nation, Prime Minister Giornato Meloni is navigating a diplomatic minefield with U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance.

The narrative surrounding these games is fracturing along predictable political lines. While *Il Giornale* and *Libero* are busy celebrating the "Italian Miracle" and the organizational resilience of Milan-Cortina, the opposition press is looking at the cracks in the ice. *Il Fatto Quotidiano* is highlighting the protests at the PalaSharp, where antagonists have occupied the space to denounce the "cementification of the mountains" and the militarization of the city. Furthermore, a cultural skirmish is brewing over the artist Ghali, who will perform tonight. After weeks of polemics regarding his pro-Palestinian stance, *La Repubblica* reports he will recite a poem by Gianni Rodari against war, a choice that Minister Valditara, quoted in *Libero*, dismissed by saying he "doesn't want to talk about controversies on a day of celebration," effectively trying to silence the noise before the anthem plays.

Moving from the fanfare of the stadium to the panic on the trading floor, the industrial pillar of the country is shaking.

Stellantis has suffered what financial analysts are calling a "bloodbath." The stock plummeted nearly 25% after the automotive giant warned it burnt through 22 billion euros trying to manage a slowing electric vehicle market and would suspend dividends. *Il Sole 24 Ore* delivers the cold, hard math: the transition to electric is costing more than expected, and the market is punishing the uncertainty. But the political fallout is where the story gets interesting. *La Stampa*, historically the voice of the Turin industrial establishment, treats this as a tragedy for Italian labor, amplifying CEO Antonio Filosa's admission of "too many errors."

However, the spin from the Right is aggressive and distinct. *La Verità* leads with a cynical take on Chairman John Elkann, noting that after years of "green rhetoric," the company is now writing to Brussels to demand protectionism and subsidies to survive the Asian competition. The paper accuses the Agnelli-Elkann dynasty of socializing losses while privatizing profits, framing the crash not just as a business failure, but as the collapse of the "Green Deal" ideology itself. The government is watching closely; if Stellantis sneezes, the Italian supply chain catches pneumonia.

Turning our attention to the courts, a dormant volcano has just woken up.

The Supreme Court of Cassation has accepted the signatures for the referendum on the "Separation of Careers" for magistrates, a reform that would structurally divide judges from prosecutors. This is the "Mother of all Reforms" for the Justice Ministry. *Il Giornale* is cheering this as the beginning of the end for the "politicized judiciary," arguing that the people will finally break the caste system within the courts. Minister Nordio, feeling the wind in his sails, is quoted telling the press that victory is certain. Conversely, *Il Fatto Quotidiano* and *La Repubblica* are sounding the alarm, framing this as a government plot to subjugate the judiciary under the guise of efficiency. With the referendum potentially slated for spring, the country is bracing for a polarizing campaign that will pit the government directly against the robes of the state.

But before we go, we must address a diplomatic incident that is equal parts embarrassing and hilarious.

While Vice President Vance was in Milan meeting Prime Minister Meloni, the U.S. State Department released an official readout of the lunch that contained a glaring error. As reported with some glee by *La Stampa*, the American document listed the participants as "The Vice President and Mrs. Meloni," and then, inexplicably, listed a "Mr. Meloni" as her spouse. The problem? Giorgia Meloni is not married, and she certainly didn't bring a phantom husband to a diplomatic summit. The "spouse" listed was actually a misidentified member of the entourage. It was a clerical error that forced a hasty correction from Washington, proving that while American intelligence might know about Russian generals, their knowledge of the Italian Premier's relationship status leaves something to be desired.

I will see you tomorrow.

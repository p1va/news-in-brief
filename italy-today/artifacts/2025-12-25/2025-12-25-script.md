**ITALY TODAY**

Welcome, I am your host Amelia. Today is Thursday, December 25. Today's episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

**SECTION 1: THE LEAD**

We begin with a Christmas that is less about peace and joy, and more about sirens and sandbags. While the lights are twinkling in Rome, the reality in Emilia-Romagna remains critical. Following up on yesterday’s report regarding the "polar vortex," the situation has escalated into a full-blown emergency.

*Il Sole 24 Ore* and *Corriere della Sera* confirm that the "Red Alert" is active today. In the Ravenna area, specifically around the Senio river, the holidays have been suspended: evacuations have been ordered as water levels threaten to breach the banks yet again. While families across Italy were sitting down for lunch, civil protection units were deploying across the mud-soaked plains of the north. It is a bitter sense of déjà vu for a region that has spent too much of the last two years underwater.

Meanwhile, in the Vatican, the new Pontiff, Leone XIV, delivered his first "Urbi et Orbi" blessing, and the tone was far from festive. The Pope did not mince words. *Corriere della Sera* highlights his explicit condemnation of the "distorted economy" that treats humans as merchandise and acts as a catalyst for war. He specifically called for direct dialogue between Moscow and Kyiv to end the slaughter. The reactions, naturally, are split. While the mainstream press focuses on his spiritual appeal for peace, *Libero Quotidiano* frames it as a "strigliata"—a scolding—where the Pope essentially told the Church and the world to stop focusing on the "market" of Christmas and look at the "tents of Gaza."

**SECTION 2: THE ROUNDUP**

Moving from the floods to the forests, we return to the culture war of the week: the "Family in the Woods."

As we noted yesterday, the case of the Finnish-German family living off-grid whose children were seized by the state has become a major flashpoint. *La Repubblica* reports a bittersweet development today: the father was granted a "lightning visit" with his children for Christmas. However, it was strictly controlled—a supervised encounter that notably did not include Christmas lunch. This bureaucratic strictness has enraged the Right. *Libero Quotidiano* and *Il Giornale* are amplifying the fury of Matteo Salvini, who called the decision "shameful" and a "violence of the State," arguing that denying a family a meal together on December 25th is an act of cruelty, regardless of the parents' lifestyle choices.

Turning our attention south, the festivities in Naples were marred by a tragedy that feels depressingly familiar.

While the rest of the country was unwrapping gifts, *Fanpage* and *Il Giornale* report that a seven-year-old boy was shot and wounded in Naples on Christmas Eve. The initial reconstruction suggests the child was hit by a stray bullet fired during "celebratory" shooting—a dangerous local "tradition" that authorities struggle to eradicate. He is currently hospitalized at the Santobono hospital. For the Right-wing press, this is evidence of lawlessness in the South; for the local papers, it is a heartbreaking reminder that in some neighborhoods, the line between celebration and crime is non-existent.

**SECTION 3: THE WRAP-UP**

But before we go, here is a rapid-fire scan of the rest of the newsstand:

First, a dose of nostalgia. *Il Post* and *Corriere* report the death of Paolo Bontempi at the age of 83. If you grew up in Italy—or anywhere in Europe—in the last forty years, you likely owned one of his small, orange chaotic electric keyboards. He was the man who put a synthesizer in every child's bedroom.

Also, the geopolitics of well-wishing. *Corriere* notes that Vladimir Putin sent Christmas greetings to Donald Trump and Viktor Orbán, but conspicuously ignored the leaders of "unfriendly" nations. Meanwhile, *Libero* seizes on a darker headline from Kyiv, where President Zelensky, in his speech, evoked a "dream" that everyone shares—implying the death of the Russian leader.

And finally, a grim statistic that the Italian press seems obsessed with today. Almost every major paper, from *Adnkronos* to *La Stampa*, is reporting multiple incidents of people choking to death on Panettone or fruit during Christmas Eve dinners. It is a macabre detail to focus on, but perhaps fitting for a news cycle that—even on Christmas—refuses to look away from the darker side of life.

That is the state of the country today. Merry Christmas, Buon Natale, and I will see you tomorrow.

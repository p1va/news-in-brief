Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", today is Monday 26 and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

Let’s get straight to the pulse of the nation. The institutional war between the Government and the Judiciary has reached a boiling point after a controversial social media post by the Magistrates' Union secretary; in the Middle East, a diplomatic incident involving Italian Carabinieri and an armed Israeli settler has triggered a summons to the Farnesina; meanwhile, the earth is literally opening up in Sicily, with half the town of Niscemi sliding down a hill, displacing over a thousand people. In the north, the Olympic torch is already burning—but with controversy, as Minister Abodi preemptively silences the singer Ghali regarding Gaza; and finally, a tragic update to the Anguillara femicide, where the parents of the killer have taken their own lives, crushed by public shame.

But we begin with the open warfare consuming the Ministry of Justice, a clash that has moved from parliamentary debate to what **Libero** and **Il Giornale** are characterizing as a grotesque institutional suicide by the magistracy.

The spark was a now-deleted post by Rocco Maruotti, the secretary of the ANM—the National Association of Magistrates. Maruotti posted an image of Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a man killed by federal agents in Minneapolis, and juxtaposed it with the Nordio Justice Reform, captioning it: "Also this state murder will remain unpunished in that 'democracy' whose judicial system inspires the Meloni-Nordio reform." It was a clumsy attempt to criticize the separation of careers, but the backlash was instant. Justice Minister Carlo Nordio, usually reserved, called the comparison "disgusting" and the subsequent apology "unacceptable," suggesting it reveals an intellect inadequate for the office. For the Right-wing press, this is the smoking gun they have been waiting for: proof that the judiciary is politicized, anti-American, and ideologically opposed to the government.

However, if you look at the **AGI** wire services, there is a darker undercurrent to this paranoia. The Magistrates are on edge because of rumors that the Ministry has installed "remote control" software on their computers capable of turning on webcams—a claim the National Cybersecurity Agency (ACN) had to formally deny today. **La Repubblica** frames this as a total breakdown of trust: on one side, a government pushing a reform that separates judges from prosecutors; on the other, a judiciary that feels besieged, spied upon, and is now lashing out with communication blunders that undermine its own authority.

Moving from the internal courts to the external borders, the concept of national sovereignty is being tested on two very different fronts.

First, in the West Bank, where **La Stampa** and **Corriere della Sera** report a humiliation for the Italian uniform. Two Carabinieri, part of a diplomatic protection unit at the Jerusalem Consulate, were forced to their knees and held at gunpoint by an armed Israeli settler—not a soldier—while conducting a site visit. Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani has summoned the Israeli ambassador, demanding answers. While **Il Giornale** reports the facts, the centrist and leftist press are asking a harder question: if Italy cannot protect its own paramilitary police from civilians in an occupied territory, what is the weight of Rome's influence in Tel Aviv?

Simultaneously, a mirror image of this sovereignty anxiety is playing out in Milan regarding the upcoming Olympics. **La Repubblica** and **Il Fatto Quotidiano** are amplifying concerns about the presence of U.S. ICE agents (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) operating on Italian soil to protect American dignitaries. Following the violent tactics used by ICE in Minneapolis, the Italian Left is petitioning to ban them, fearing "Trump's squads" in Cortina. The Viminale has issued a denial, stating ICE will not have operational powers, but the narrative synthesis is clear: from the West Bank to the Alps, the Meloni government is struggling to assert Italian jurisdiction against its own allies.

While the politicians debate jurisdiction, the physical infrastructure of the country is failing.

In Sicily, the situation in Niscemi has gone from an emergency to a catastrophe. **Il Sole 24 Ore** reports that the landslide front has widened to four kilometers. A thousand people have been evacuated, schools are closed, and the Vice President of the Regional Assembly warns, "Half the city is collapsing." This isn't just bad weather; it is the bill coming due for decades of hydrogeological neglect. The contrast with the government's grand projects is stark. As **Fanpage** and **La Stampa** point out, while Niscemi slides into the valley, Matteo Salvini is in a heated battle with the Court of Auditors over the Bridge on the Straits of Messina. The magistrates have warned that the government's new decree reduces controls and oversight on the massive project; Salvini calls their interference "incredible." The takeaway is a country split in two: one spending billions on future engineering marvels, and another unable to keep existing towns from falling off the map.

Briefly updating a story we covered yesterday regarding the horror in Anguillara: the tragedy has compounded. Following the femicide of Federica Torzullo, the parents of the confessing killer, Claudio Carlomagno, were found dead by suicide. **Corriere della Sera** reports that prosecutors are opening a file for "instigation to suicide," investigating whether the "social media pillorying"—the relentless online attacks against the family—drove the elderly couple to their deaths. It is a grim reminder of the toxic speed of digital justice.

But before we go, a discovery in the archives that reminds us of Italian ingenuity before the industrial age. **AGI** reports that a researcher in Padua has uncovered a document from January 26, 1604—exactly 422 years ago today. It is essentially the first patent for a pasta machine. A man named Bortolamio Veronese, nicknamed "L'Abbondanza" (The Abundance), registered a "torcio bigolaro," a wooden press to mass-produce *bigoli* pasta. It’s a small, dusty piece of history, but it signals that four centuries ago, while Europe was fighting wars of religion, someone in Veneto was already figuring out how to make dinner more efficient.

That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.

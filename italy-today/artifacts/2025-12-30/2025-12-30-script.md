[energetic] Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", I am your host Amelia, Today is Tuesday, December 30, and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

[newscaster] The long political marathon of 2025 has officially crossed the finish line. The Chamber of Deputies gave its final approval to the Budget Law this evening, securing the Meloni government's economic roadmap for the coming year. According to **ANSA**, the maneuvering is over, and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is claiming victory, calling the package "serious and responsible," designed to keep Italy competitive without breaking the bank. **Il Giornale** echoes the government's satisfaction, highlighting the stability of the coalition and the confirmation of tax cuts for lower-income workers.

[cynical] However, if you read the opposition press, the narrative changes from "responsibility" to "class warfare." **La Repubblica** and **La Stampa** are amplifying the fury of Elly Schlein and the Democratic Party, who describe the budget as a gift to the wealthy and a slap in the face to public healthcare. **Il Fatto Quotidiano** goes further, latching onto the term "Affarismo"—or business-first cronyism—as the new motto of the executive. While Minister Giorgetti denies these accusations as "falsehoods," the stark division in the headlines confirms that while the law has passed, the social truce remains fragile as we head into 2026.

[newscaster] Following up on yesterday’s report regarding the suspension of TV mogul Alfonso Signorini, the situation has escalated from a corporate shake-up to a full-blown judicial scandal. **Corriere Della Sera** and **Adnkronos** report that the "King of Gossip" continues to dominate the headlines, but now for all the wrong reasons: he is formally under investigation by Milan prosecutors for sexual violence and extortion.

[cynical] The media reaction is a study in schadenfreude and defense. **La Repubblica** runs a biting headline declaring that "Gossip is Dead," interviewing critics who see this as the collapse of a toxic television culture. **Fanpage** and **Il Fatto Quotidiano** are particularly aggressive, reporting on consumer groups like Codacons demanding that his show, "Big Brother," be pulled off the air entirely. Meanwhile, **Il Giornale** and **Libero**, traditionally closer to the Mediaset ecosystem, are treading carefully, reporting the investigation as an "inevitable act" following the complaints, but holding fire on the moral condemnation until the dust settles.

[somber] Moving from the television studios to the Alps, a wave of fear swept through the Piedmont region this afternoon. **La Stampa** reports a serious accident involving the Macugnaga cable car, where a cabin slammed into the station, injuring four people and leaving over one hundred skiers stranded at 2,800 meters. While helicopters successfully evacuated the tourists, the incident has reopened old wounds in a country still traumatized by the Mottarone tragedy. **Corriere Della Sera** notes that while the winter tourism season is booming with sold-out hotels, infrastructure safety remains a persistent anxiety looming over the holidays.

[energetic] But before we go, here is a quick scan of the rest of the newsstand.

[somber] First, a tragic mystery in Milan has been solved. **Fanpage** and **Corriere** confirm that the body of the young woman found in a courtyard yesterday has been identified as 19-year-old Aurora Livoli, who had been missing from Latina since November. Investigators are now piecing together her final movement in the city.

[newscaster] Also, there is movement on the industrial front. **Il Sole Ventiquattro Ore** reports that the government has entered exclusive negotiations with the Flacks Group for the acquisition of the former Ilva steelworks in Taranto. While the deal promises investments up to 5 billion euros, unions remain skeptical about the security of jobs in the south.

[newscaster] And finally, a mixed bag for your wallet to start the year. **ANSA** reports that from January 1st, excise duties on diesel fuel will rise, pushing up the cost of transport. However, there is a silver lining: electricity bills for vulnerable households are set to drop by nearly 3% in the first quarter of 2026.

[newscaster] That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.

[energetic] Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", I am your host Amelia, Today is Friday 16 and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

[cynical] Following up on yesterday’s report regarding the earthquake at the Privacy Guarantor, the scandal has shifted from the institutional to the grotesque. If yesterday was about the raid, today is about the receipts. **Corriere Della Sera** and **La Repubblica** are publishing humiliating details this morning: investigations reveal that public funds were allegedly used not just for luxury hotels, but for personal perks ranging from airline status upgrades to bills at a local butcher shop. The narrative has quickly turned from administrative corruption to petty greed, with **Repubblica** explicitly accusing the board members—who earn huge salaries—of being "attached to their seats" solely for the perks, treating state resources like a private expense account.

[newscaster] The political fallout is getting messy. While the opposition calls for resignations, the Right-wing press is engaging in a swift damage control operation. **La Verità** and **Libero** are pushing a specific counter-narrative: they remind their readers that the current board was appointed during the previous "Yellow-Red" government of Giuseppe Conte and the Democratic Party. Their headline strategy is clear: this is a scandal of the Left's appointees, not the current Meloni administration. **Il Giornale** takes it a step further, calling for the dissolution of the board, framing the investigation not just as a legal issue, but as a symptom of a bloated bureaucratic caste that needs to be purged.

[somber] But while Rome argues over butcher bills, a classroom in Liguria turned into a crime scene this morning. In a story that dominates the afternoon cycle, a 19-year-old student at a professional institute in La Spezia stabbed an 18-year-old classmate during a lesson. **La Stampa** reports the victim is in critical condition after undergoing emergency surgery. The attacker, who reportedly brought the weapon from home, is in custody. This has immediately triggered a political reaction on school safety: Education Minister Giuseppe Valditara condemned the act as "gravissimo," while **Il Giornale** reports that Deputy Premier Matteo Salvini is already using the tragedy to call for a crackdown on carrying weapons, signaling that the government's "law and order" agenda will now likely extend into the school system.

[newscaster] Turning to the economy, the country seems to be living in two different realities today. **Il Sole 24 Ore** released sobering data on inflation, noting that while the general rate is stabilizing, the cost of the "shopping cart"—essential goods—has risen by a staggering 24% over the last five years. **Adnkronos** adds that energy costs are up 34% in the same period, hitting lower-income families the hardest.

[cynical] Yet, just up the road, the reality is starkly different. **Corriere Della Sera** and **Fanpage** highlight a report naming Milan as the "city of millionaires," with one millionaire for every 12 residents—a density higher than New York or London. The narrative emerging from the press today is one of a fractured Italy: a wealthy, globalized elite in Lombardy thriving on high finance, while the rest of the country struggles to pay for groceries and electricity.

[energetic] But before we go, here is a quick scan of the rest of the newsstand.

[newscaster] First, thousands gathered in Rome's Piazza del Campidoglio to protest the repression in Iran. **La Stampa** notes the heavy presence of the opposition leaders, with Elly Schlein and Giuseppe Conte standing united, while government representatives were notably absent, fueling the Left's accusation that Rome is too soft on Tehran.

[cynical] Also, a sad family feud has erupted in the motor racing world. **Il Giornale** reports that Italian legend Valentino Rossi has taken legal action against his own father's partner. The accusation is "circumvention of an incapable person," with Rossi alleging she siphoned 200,000 euros from the accounts of his father, Graziano.

[somber] And finally, Italy says goodbye to a voice that defined an era. **Corriere Della Sera** leads its culture section with the death of Tony Dallara at age 89. The singer, famous for hits like "Romantica," is being eulogized today as the man who modernized Italian music in the late 50s, bridging the gap between melody and the "urlo" of early rock and roll.

[newscaster] That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.

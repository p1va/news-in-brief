**ITALY TODAY**

Welcome, I am your host Amelia. Today is Tuesday, December 23. Today's episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

**SECTION 1: THE LEAD**

We begin with the money. Following up on yesterday's report about the frantic race to close the books, the Senate has officially approved the 2025 Budget Law.

The "Manovra"—a 22-billion-euro package—passed with 110 votes in favor and 66 against, effectively securing the government's economic roadmap just under the holiday wire. The narrative war is, predictable, split cleanly down the middle. Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti is taking a victory lap, quoted by *Il Sole 24 Ore* and *Adnkronos* as saying the government achieved "things that seemed impossible," navigating tight fiscal constraints without triggering a market revolt. The establishment Right, represented by *Il Giornale*, frames this as a triumph of "common sense" and stability.

However, the view from the Opposition benches is far less festive. *La Repubblica* and *Il Fatto Quotidiano* describe the vote as a rubber-stamping of austerity, accusing Premier Meloni of a "voltafaccia"—a complete about-face—on her campaign promises regarding pension cuts and healthcare funding. *Il Fatto* is particularly aggressive, noting that while the government preaches prudence for workers, the controversial liability shield for public administrators—which we flagged yesterday—seems to have slipped through the noise. The bill now heads to the Chamber of Deputies for a final, formal ratification, but for all intents and purposes, the deal is done.

**SECTION 2: THE ROUNDUP**

Moving from the treasury to a symbolic cultural battle, the Quirinale has issued a directive that hits the Italian Right where it breathes: the National Anthem.

*Corriere della Sera* and *ANSA* report that the military has been ordered to stop shouting the word "Sì!" at the very end of the *Inno di Mameli*. For years, it has been a custom—popularized in stadiums and embraced by nationalist politicians—to scream "Yes!" after the line "L'Italia chiamò." But strictly speaking, that word isn't in the score. The Presidency of the Republic has decided to restore the "original solemnity" of the piece. *Il Giornale* notes the irony with a smirk: practically moments after the news broke, Premier Meloni was filmed with the Alpini troops, enthusiastically shouting the now-banned "Sì." It is a small detail, but in Italy, tell a politician to be silent, and they will instinctively shout louder.

Turning to the courts, a dark shadow has been cast over the Five Star Movement, albeit indirectly. The motivations for the sexual assault conviction of Ciro Grillo—son of the movement’s founder Beppe Grillo—have been released, and they are damning.

*La Repubblica* and *Il Giornale*—usually at odds—are reporting the same grim details from the judges: the assault on the young woman was characterized by "particular brutality" and the "abuse of her fragility." The court explicitly rejected the defense's strategy of undermining the victim's credibility. While *Fanpage* focuses on the vindication of the victim after a grueling media trial, *Il Giornale* uses the "brutality" of the act to hammer the moral standing of the Grillo family. It is a judicial conclusion that leaves little room for political spin.

**SECTION 3: THE WRAP-UP**

But before we go, here is a final scan of the newsstand:

First, a political earthquake in the Emilia-Romagna region. *Il Giornale*, *La Repubblica*, and *Il Sole* all report that the PD Mayor of Cervia, Mattia Missiroli, has resigned after being placed under investigation for domestic abuse. It is a rapid fall from grace that has left the local Democratic Party reeling right before Christmas.

Also, the saga of Fabrizio Corona and TV host Alfonso Signorini continues to degrade. Following our report yesterday, Corona appeared in court today, threatening to unleash an "Italian Me Too" moment and claiming to have over 100 testimonies against the "Signorini System." It is pure tabloid theater, but as *Fanpage* notes, it is dominating the social conversation.

And finally, a bizarre crime story out of Verona that has confused everyone. *Il Sole 24 Ore* reports that a 25-year-old man has been identified as the person who shot at a group of cyclists with an air rifle. His motive? He simply has a "marked aversion" to bicycles. In Italy, where the cyclist-motorist war is eternal, this is unfortunately the most relatable headline of the day.

That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.

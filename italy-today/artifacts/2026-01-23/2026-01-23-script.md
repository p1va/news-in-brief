[energetic] Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", today is Friday 23 and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

[quick pause]

[newscaster] The last Emperor leaves Rome. **Il Messaggero** reports that thousands gathered at the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli to bid farewell to Valentino, amid white roses and the notes of Mozart. From mourning to political maneuvering, **Corriere della Sera** headlines the new "Rome-Berlin Axis," as Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni meets German conservative leader Friedrich Merz to reshape the European Union. In the Swiss courts, outrage erupts: **Adnkronos** confirms that Jacques Moretti, owner of the "Constellation" club where 40 people died on New Year's Eve, has been released on bail. In the business world, a family feud shakes the poultry industry: **Il Sole 24 Ore** details how the sisters of the Amadori dynasty won a court battle against their brothers to regain control of the food giant. And finally, Maranello unveils the future: **La Repubblica** showcases the new Ferrari SF-26, featuring a vintage white livery that Lewis Hamilton hopes will bring the title back to Italy. But we begin with the diplomatic tightrope walk between Rome, Berlin, and Washington.

[newscaster] Following up on yesterday's report about Giorgia Meloni's conspicuous absence from Donald Trump's "Board of Peace," the Italian Prime Minister has finally broken her silence, and she did so while forging a new alliance. **La Repubblica** reports that Meloni hosted Friedrich Merz—the man widely expected to be the next German Chancellor—at Villa Doria Pamphilj. The headline is clear: Italy and Germany want to lead a new, more competitive Europe. However, the elephant in the room remains the American President.

[cynical] It is a masterclass in political ambiguity. **Libero** and **Il Giornale** cheer the meeting as the birth of a pragmatic "Right-Wing Axis" in Europe, destined to isolate Emmanuel Macron. They highlight Meloni’s assertion that Italy *wants* to cooperate with Trump but cannot join his "Board of Peace" in its current form due to "constitutional incompatibilities"—a polite legal excuse to avoid signing a document that includes controversial figures. **Il Fatto Quotidiano**, however, spots the desperation in the maneuvering. They note that while Merz bluntly called Trump’s peace plan "unacceptable," Meloni tried to sweeten the rejection by suggesting that, hopefully, they can one day "give Trump the Nobel Peace Prize." The takeaway is that Rome is trying to pivot to Berlin for economic safety, while desperately trying not to offend the ego in the Oval Office.

[pause]

[somber] Moving from high diplomacy to visceral outrage, the wounds of the Crans-Montana tragedy have been ripped open again.

[newscaster] Less than a month after the fire that claimed 40 lives, the Swiss judiciary has made a move that has stunned Italy. **Corriere della Sera** reports that Jacques Moretti, the owner of the "Constellation" nightclub, has been released from prison after an unidentified "close friend" paid his bail of 200,000 Swiss Francs. The judges in Sion argued there is no flight risk, but the reaction from Rome was immediate and furious.

[cynical] The government is treating this as a personal affront. **La Stampa** and **Adnkronos** amplify the reaction of Prime Minister Meloni, who stated she is "indignant" and considers the release an "insult to the victims' families." **Il Giornale** goes further, using the headline "Shame," and quoting Deputy PM Matteo Salvini’s blistering attack on the Swiss legal system. While **Repubblica** notes that Moretti still faces charges of negligent homicide and arson, the optics of the club owner walking free while teenagers are still fighting for their lives in hospitals has triggered a diplomatic friction that goes beyond mere legal procedure.

[pause]

[somber] We turn now to a moment of silence in the capital, where the fashion world has paused to honor its last Emperor.

[newscaster] It was a funeral fit for a head of state, but with better tailoring. **Il Messaggero** and **La Stampa** describe the scene at the Basilica of Saint Mary of the Angels, where the funeral of Valentino Garavani took place today. **Corriere della Sera** paints a vivid picture: a sea of white roses—his favorite flower—and a front row that included Anne Hathaway, Anna Wintour, and the entire hierarchy of Italian luxury.

[newscaster] The coverage across the spectrum, from **Il Foglio** to **Repubblica**, drops all political divisions to mourn a man who defined "Made in Italy." The most poignant moment, however, was not the celebrity sightings, but the eulogy from his life partner, Bruce Hoeksema, who broke down while saying, "I do not say goodbye, but thank you." It is the end of an era for Rome; as one banner in the crowd read: "We have lost our most beautiful flower."

[pause]

[energetic] But before we go, let's head to the racetrack, where the future is looking vintage.

[newscaster] The Prancing Horse has a new look. **La Repubblica** and **Gazzetta** have unveiled the new Ferrari SF-26, the car that will carry the hopes of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton. The shocker? It features a significant amount of white alongside the traditional red, a throwback to the livery of the 1970s. The car completed its first laps at the Fiorano circuit today under a grey sky. The Italian press is cautiously optimistic, hoping that this mix of retro style and new engineering will finally be the formula that stops the domination of their rivals.

[newscaster] That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.

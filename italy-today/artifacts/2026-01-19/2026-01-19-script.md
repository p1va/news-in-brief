[energetic] Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", today is Monday 19 and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

[quick pause]

[newscaster] We are covering a lot of ground tonight: Spain is in mourning after a catastrophic rail disaster involving an Italian-owned train; the investigation into the Anguillara femicide takes a grisly turn; and Donald Trump doubles down on his Greenland pressure with a "no comment" on military force that has Brussels sweating. Plus, sadness in the world of television as Stefano De Martino loses his father. But first, the sun sets on an era of Italian elegance.

[pause]

[somber] The last Emperor has left the palace. Valentino Garavani, simply known to the world as Valentino, died today in Rome at the age of 93. It is rare that **La Repubblica**, **Il Giornale**, and **Corriere Della Sera** sing in perfect unison, but today there is no political divide, only a national salute to the man who defined Italian couture for half a century. From the "Rosso Valentino"—a color so specific it became a trademark—to dressing everyone from Jackie Kennedy to Julia Roberts, the press is treating this not just as the death of a stylist, but as the end of the "Dolce Vita" era.

[newscaster] While the tributes are pouring in from the Prime Minister to the President of the Republic, the media is also dissecting the legacy he leaves behind. **La Repubblica** focuses heavily on the human side, spotlighting Giancarlo Giammetti, his partner in life and business for over fifty years, calling theirs a "miraculous" bond that survived the pressures of a global empire. **Il Sole 24 Ore**, always looking at the ledger, reminds us that while the creative genius was Italian, the empire itself has long been in the hands of the Qatari royal family and Kering, a stark reminder of how the ownership of Italian luxury has shifted abroad, even as the style remains proudly Roman.

[pause]

[newscaster] Moving from the end of an era to a tragedy unfolding in Spain, specifically in Andalusia, where a high-speed rail disaster has left at least 39 dead. This story has deep relevance for Rome because one of the trains involved belongs to Iryo, a company majority-owned by Italy's Trenitalia.

[somber] The details are harrowing. **La Stampa** and **Libero** report that a broken track joint—a "giunto rotto"—caused the derailment that occurred in just 20 fatal seconds. **La Repubblica** highlights the Italian connection, noting that the train was a Frecciarossa 1000, the jewel of our fleet, though early investigations point to infrastructure failure rather than the train itself. While specialized teams from Italy are rushing to the scene to assist, the Spanish press is calling this a "catastrophe without precedent," and Italian transport unions are already watching closely, wary of what this might imply for maintenance protocols across Europe.

[pause]

[somber] Returning to domestic news, and following up on yesterday's report regarding the murder of Federica Torzullo in Anguillara, the investigation has descended into horror. The husband, Claudio Carlomagno, remains silent in prison, but leaks from the interrogation room are painting a picture of calculated brutality.

[newscaster] **Il Messaggero** and **Fanpage** report that prosecutors believe Carlomagno didn't just kill his wife; he attempted to burn and dismember the body to hinder identification before burying her under two meters of earth at his construction company. **Corriere Della Sera** notes that despite the "ferocity" described by the prosecutor, the suspect was preparing to flee. **La Stampa** adds a chilling detail about the couples' neighbors, who report hearing absolutely nothing from the detached villa, leaving investigators to piece together a crime that was as silent as it was violent.

[pause]

[energetic] But before we go, let's look at a story that has **Libero** fuming and etiquette experts confused.

[cynical] If you enjoy squeezing a packet of mayonnaise onto your fries, enjoy it while you can. **Libero** is up in arms today about a new EU regulation set to ban single-use condiment sachets—ketchup, oil, vinegar—in restaurants starting later this year to reduce plastic waste. They call it "the latest European folly," arguing it attacks hygiene and convenience for the sake of green bureaucracy. Meanwhile, **Il Messaggero** reports it plainly as part of the "Green Deal," but you can sense the collective groan from Italian restaurateurs who now have to figure out how to serve olive oil without breaking the bank or the rules.

[newscaster] That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.

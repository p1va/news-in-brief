[energetic] Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", today is Wednesday 21 and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

[quick pause]

[newscaster] The weather, the courts, and the memory of a fashion icon dominate the hour. "Cyclone Harry" hammers the South, with **La Repubblica** reporting devastating waves in Sicily and Sardinia, forcing evacuations in Catania. In a relief for the north, **Il Giorno** confirms that Diego, the 14-year-old missing for nine days, has been found safe in a Milanese clinic. The horror in Anguillara finds a grim conclusion as Claudio Carlomagno confesses to killing his wife, claiming he did it "to not lose his son." And in Strasbourg, a political earthquake: the EU Parliament blocks the Mercosur trade deal by just ten votes, a major blow to Ursula von der Leyen. But we start in Switzerland, where the global order is shaking.

[pause]

[newscaster] The World Economic Forum in Davos has turned into a diplomatic battlefield, and the Italian press is scrambling to interpret the fallout. Donald Trump has arrived, and he is not taking prisoners. **Corriere della Sera** leads with the headline "Unrecognizable Europe," detailing a speech where the former President doubled down on his desire to "negotiate" the purchase of Greenland, warning European leaders that if they say no, "we will remember it." The paper adds a juicy detail that is causing waves in financial circles: Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, reportedly walked out of a gala dinner in protest after Trump's Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, launched a fierce critique of the European Union.

[cynical] The divide in the Italian reaction is sharp. **La Stampa** is horrified, running an editorial that describes Trump's Greenland ultimatum as a "Mafia-style threat" against the continent, while **Fanpage** calls it the "true face of new American imperialism." On the other side of the aisle, **Libero** and **La Verità** are far less scandalized. **La Verità** mocks the outrage, noting that Ursula von der Leyen has admitted the Arctic wasn't a priority until Trump made it one, essentially arguing that the EU is panicking because its own strategic weakness has been exposed.

[newscaster] The takeaway here is clear: the transatlantic bridge is creaking under heavy winds. While **Il Sole 24 Ore** worries about the economic instability caused by this rhetoric, the political reality is that Europe is bracing for impact, and Rome is watching closely to see if Prime Minister Meloni’s relationship with Trump will be a shield or a liability.

[pause]

[newscaster] Turning our gaze back to Rome, a different kind of storm is brewing between the government and the judiciary. The trigger is an explosive report from the investigative program "Report," which alleges that a software installed on 40,000 computers within the Justice Ministry and Tribunals allows for remote tracking and "spying" on magistrates.

[cynical] It is a story that fits perfectly into the current polarized climate. **La Repubblica** amplifies the alarm, quoting a magistrate who claims, "They were already watching me," painting a picture of a "Big Brother" state monitoring its own judges. The center-left opposition is already calling for parliamentary inquiries. However, **Il Giornale** and **Libero** are treating this with heavy skepticism, publishing Justice Minister Carlo Nordio’s furious denial. Nordio calls the accusations "surreal," insisting the software is standard maintenance tech used since 2019, long before this government took power. **Il Fatto Quotidiano**, usually the first to attack the government on justice, is watching carefully, noting this could be the spark that ignites a total war between the executive branch and the prosecutors.

[pause]

[somber] We move now to the story we opened with yesterday: the farewell to Valentino. If yesterday was about the shock of loss, today is about the overwhelming affection. **AGI** and **La Stampa** report that over 5,000 people have already lined up at Piazza Mignanelli to pay their respects at the *camera ardente*. The atmosphere is respectful, accompanied by the notes of Bach and Mozart. **Corriere della Sera** paints a moving portrait of the scene, highlighting the presence of Bruce Hoeksema, Valentino’s partner of recent years, who arrived visibly devastated, holding the late designer's beloved pugs.

[newscaster] But as the public mourns the man, the financial press is dissecting the empire. **La Repubblica** and **Il Sole 24 Ore** are digging into the mechanics of the inheritance. With no direct heirs, the focus is shifting to the nephews and the precise role of the "Garavani Giammetti Foundation." While the emotional legacy is secure in the hands of Giancarlo Giammetti, who described Valentino as a "dreamer who loved beauty," the management of palaces, art, and liquid assets worth over a billion euros is a complex legal web that is only just beginning to unravel.

[pause]

[energetic] But before we go, a phoenix is rising from the ashes of a reputation crisis.

[cynical] **Il Giornale** and **La Repubblica** report that Chiara Ferragni is officially back in business. After the "Pandoro-gate" scandal decimated her sponsorships and sent her into a long professional exile, the influencer has landed her first major contract since the fall. She is the new global face of Guess. The campaign is already rolling out, signaling that in the world of fashion and marketing, memory is short, and forgiveness—or at least profit—is just a season away.

[newscaster] That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.

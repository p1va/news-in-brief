[energetic] Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", I am your host Amelia, Today is Thursday 15 and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

[newscaster] The watchdog has become the hunted. In a stunning institutional earthquake this morning, the Guardia di Finanza raided the headquarters of the Privacy Guarantor in Rome—the very authority responsible for protecting citizens' data. **AGI** and **Il Sole 24 Ore** report that the entire board, including President Pasquale Stanzione, is under investigation for corruption and embezzlement. The allegations are granular and damaging: prosecutors suspect the board members accepted perks, including elite status cards from ITA Airways and reimbursements for personal luxury expenses, in exchange for lenient oversight on data privacy violations.

[cynical] The political timing is explosive, largely because **La Repubblica** and **Il Fatto Quotidiano** are claiming a direct victory for investigative journalism. They note that the raid comes specifically after an exposé by the TV program "Report" detailed these "crazy expenses." **Libero**, with a sharper edge, frames it as a worrying symbiosis between the media and the judiciary, running the headline "Report calls, the Prosecutors answer," suggesting that television investigations are now dictating the agenda of the Rome magistrates. The takeaway is awkward for the establishment: an institution designed to police corporate behavior is now accused of selling its silence for flight upgrades and hotel bills.

[somber] Following up on yesterday's report regarding the crisis in Iran, the drums of war have quieted slightly, but the moral condemnation has reached the highest level of the Italian state. President Sergio Mattarella, usually measured in his foreign policy remarks, decried the "atrocious extermination" of young protesters by the regime, a sentiment echoed across **Corriere Della Sera** and **La Stampa**. However, the immediate threat of a US invasion seems to have paused.

[newscaster] While yesterday **La Repubblica** warned of an attack within 24 hours, today they, along with **The New York Times**, report a sudden pump of the brakes: Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly asked Donald Trump to delay any strike on Tehran. **La Verità**, maintaining its focus on the hard-right geopolitical angle, suggests this delay is tactical, while noting that Italy has advised all nationals to leave the country immediately. The situation remains volatile, but for now, the missiles remain in their silos.

[newscaster] Turning to domestic politics, the government coalition showed visible cracks today during the vote to send aid to Ukraine. While the resolution passed, **Il Fatto Quotidiano** highlights a significant rebellion within the League: two deputies voted against the majority, and prominent Senator Claudio Borghi staged a walkout. **La Stampa** views this as a headache for Prime Minister Meloni, suggesting the "Vannacci effect"—referring to the General critical of the war—is radicalizing a wing of the party against the Atlanticist line. **Il Giornale**, trying to hold the line for the government, downplays the dissent, focusing instead on Foreign Minister Tajani’s assurance that Rome stands firm with Kiev, but the optical unity of the Right is undeniably frayed.

[energetic] But before we go, here is a quick scan of the rest of the newsstand.

[newscaster] First, a thirty-year-old cold case has finally closed. **La Stampa** reports that a Genoa court has convicted calm former teacher Anna Lucia Cecere to 24 years in prison for the 1996 murder of secretary Nada Cella. The victim's employer, a commercialist, was also sentenced for aiding and abetting the cover-up.

[somber] Also, a tragic end to a search in the Veneto region. **Fanpage** and **Corriere** confirm that Annabella Martinelli, the 22-year-old student who vanished on Epiphany, was found dead in the Euganean Hills today in an apparent suicide. The discovery has silenced what was quickly becoming a national media frenzy.

[cynical] And finally, a new flashpoint for the self-defense debate. **Libero** is leading with a furious campaign regarding a home invasion in Lonate Pozzolo, where a homeowner killed a robber. The paper claims the robber's family, from a local Roma camp, is now "swearing revenge," turning a local crime story into a national political battleground over security and justice.

[newscaster] That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.

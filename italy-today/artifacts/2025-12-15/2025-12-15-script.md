**THE ROMAN OBSERVER**

Buongiorno, I am Amelia. It is Monday 15, and here is the view from Rome. Today's briefing was curated by DeepSeek-V3.2-Special.

**PART 1: THE HEADLINES (The "Terza Pagina")**

1. **The Imam's Release: Government vs Judiciary**  
   - **The Fact:** A Turin court ordered the release of Tunisian imam Mohamed Shahin from a detention center, ruling his continued detention unlawful.  
   - **The Spin:** While left-leaning La Repubblica reported the decision with a focus on the legal reasoning, right-wing Il Giornale echoed Premier Meloni's outrage, accusing the judiciary of undermining national security.  
   - **The Takeaway:** The case underscores the escalating conflict between the executive and the judiciary over immigration policy, with both sides digging in.

2. **Budget Ballooning: 3.5 Billion for Businesses, Bridge Funds Delayed**  
   - **The Fact:** The government unveiled a last-minute package of €3.5 billion in the budget law, earmarked for business support, while postponing funding for the controversial Messina Bridge project.  
   - **The Spin:** Opposition parties and left-wing media slammed the move as proof of disarray, while Economy Minister Giorgetti argued it was necessary to boost a faltering economy.  
   - **The Takeaway:** The extra spending risks widening the deficit, but the real story is the quiet shelving of a flagship infrastructure promise.

3. **John Elkann Forced to Stand Trial Over Agnelli Inheritance**  
   - **The Fact:** A Milan judge ordered the forced indictment of Fiat chairman John Elkann on fraud charges related to the inheritance of Marella Caracciolo, widow of Gianni Agnelli.  
   - **The Spin:** Center-left outlets portrayed the decision as justice catching up with the elite; right-leaning commentators called it judicial overreach and pointed to Elkann's defense labeling the ruling "abnormal."  
   - **The Takeaway:** The trial will shine an uncomfortable spotlight on Italy's most powerful industrial dynasty and could have ripple effects across the corporate landscape.

**PART 2: IL CAFFÈ (Rapid Fire)**  
- **Cannabis Sector Wins:** The Council of State ruled that companies can sell CBD oil, ending a two-year legal battle and giving a boost to Italy's hemp industry.  
- **IMF’s Mixed Report:** The IMF praised Italy's fiscal discipline but warned the government to "keep pedaling" to sustain growth and reduce public debt.  
- **Poll Shift:** A new poll shows a dip for Fratelli d'Italia and a rise for the Democratic Party, narrowing the gap.  
- **Ukraine Summit:** At the Berlin meeting, European leaders backed a multinational force for Ukraine and urged President Zelensky to consult his people on peace terms; Meloni said she expects "progress."

[energetic] Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", today is Thursday 22 and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

[quick pause]

[newscaster] The bill for the storm is in, and it is staggering. **Il Sole 24 Ore** reports that "Cyclone Harry" has caused over one billion euros in damages across Sicily, devastating the citrus industry and wiping out entire seafronts. In Florence, a landmark ruling: the Court of Appeals overturns a lower verdict, convicting an inspector and eight prison guards of torture at the Sollicciano penitentiary. In the publishing world, a major shakeup: **Il Fatto Quotidiano** notes that Leonardo Maria Del Vecchio has acquired the majority stake in the "Editoriale Nazionale" group, taking control of **Il Giorno**, **La Nazione**, and **Il Resto del Carlino**. And in Melbourne, Jannik Sinner cruises to the third round of the Australian Open, dismantling Duckworth in three sets. But we begin in the Swiss Alps, where the European Union is taking a beating from all sides.

[newscaster] If yesterday belonged to Donald Trump, today belongs to Volodymyr Zelensky, and the Ukrainian President is not in a diplomatic mood. **La Repubblica** leads with Zelensky’s blistering attack on Brussels, describing European leaders as "lost and divided." In a speech that **Libero** characterizes as a total rupture, Zelensky essentially told the EU that Vladimir Putin has won the financial war because Europe lacked the courage to seize Russian assets, warning that the continent is stuck in a "Groundhog Day" of indecision.

[cynical] The press is painting a picture of an irrelevant Europe caught between two fires. **La Stampa** focuses on the humiliation, noting that while Zelensky scolds Brussels, he is actively planning a trilateral summit with Trump and Russia in Abu Dhabi. Meanwhile, the "Board of Peace"—Trump’s new parallel UN—is taking shape. **Corriere della Sera** reports that while autocrats and populists are lining up to sign Trump's charter, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is conspicuously absent. **Il Giornale** spins this as prudence, but **Il Manifesto** argues the Italian government is terrified of legitimizing a body that includes Netanyahu and Putin, fearing it would shatter what remains of international law. The takeaway is brutal: Kiev is looking at Washington and Moscow for answers, leaving Brussels to hold the bag.

[newscaster] Back in Rome, the political dictionary is being rewritten, and the opposition is furious. The debate centers on the new law regarding sexual violence, the so-called "Ddl Stupri."

[cynical] The controversy, as highlighted by **La Stampa**, is a single word: "Consent." League Senator Giulia Bongiorno has reformulated the text, removing the explicit reference to "consent" and replacing it with the concept of "dissent" and "opposition." The Center-Left is up in arms. **Fanpage** and **La Repubblica** are amplifying the outrage from the Democratic Party and activist groups, who claim this turns the clock back decades, placing the burden on the victim to prove they said "no." On the defensive, **Libero** and **Il Giornale** mock the "hysteria" of the Left, arguing that Bongiorno’s text actually makes convictions easier by removing ambiguity and that the core protections remain intact. It is a classic culture war skirmish: the Left sees a patriarchal rollback; the Right sees pragmatic legal tweaking.

[pause]

[newscaster] Staying within the halls of justice, the war between the government and the media is heating up over the alleged "Spy Software" inside the Ministry.

[cynical] Following the explosive preview by the investigative show "Report," which claims magistrates are being monitored via maintenance software on their PCs, Justice Minister Carlo Nordio has gone on the offensive. **Il Giornale** and **Adnkronos** carry Nordio’s "dry denial," where he labels the accusations "surreal" and "fake news" designed to panic the judiciary. However, **Il Fatto Quotidiano** is not letting go, citing a magistrate from Alessandria who went on record saying, "They were already watching me." **La Verità** dismisses the whole affair as a technical misunderstanding blown out of proportion to damage the government, but the Consiglio Superiore della Magistratura is taking no chances and has opened an internal file to check if Big Brother really is watching the judges.

[pause]

[energetic] But before we go, a story about French style with a very Italian engine.

[newscaster] If you have seen recent photos of Emmanuel Macron, you might have noticed he enters rooms wearing aviator sunglasses like he is on the set of *Top Gun*. **Corriere della Sera** and **Libero** explain that the French President is suffering from a minor eye issue, but the fashion statement has had a financial consequence. The glasses are made by a French brand, Henry Jullien, which happens to be owned by the Italian company iVision Tech. Since Macron started wearing them, the company's stock on the Euronext market has skyrocketed, suspended for excess gains. It seems even when the French President tries to look cool, he ends up making money for the Italians.

[newscaster] That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.

[energetic] Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", today is Tuesday 20 and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

[quick pause]

[newscaster] We have a heavy news cycle this evening: The death toll in the Spanish rail disaster rises to 42 as King Felipe visits the crash site; clarification in the Swiss Alps tragedy as tests confirm a 16-year-old Italian golfer died from toxic fumes, not the crushing crowd; and Brussels strikes back at Donald Trump’s tariff threats with Ursula von der Leyen calling them a "structural error." Plus, Jannik Sinner cruises through the first round in Melbourne. But first, the flowers are piling up in Rome.

[pause]

[somber] Following up on yesterday's opening, the capital is preparing for the final farewell to Valentino Garavani. **La Repubblica** captures the emotional heart of the story today, quoting Giancarlo Giammetti, Valentino's partner in life and business for fifty years, who stood before the cameras at Piazza Mignanelli to say simply: "My best memory? The moment we met." It is a touching eulogy to a partnership that defined Italian fashion, painting a picture of a bond that survived the pressures of a global empire.

[newscaster] But as the tears dry, the accounting begins. **Il Giornale** and **AGI** are already looking at the ledger, estimating a personal estate worth 1.5 billion euros. The question of who inherits the villas, the castles, and the art collection is now center stage. While Giammetti is the executor of the legacy and the spiritual heir, the press notes that Valentino left no direct children, turning the spotlight onto his three nephews. It is a stark reminder from the financial press that behind the romance of the "Rosso Valentino," there is a massive asset portfolio that now must be divided.

[pause]

[somber] We must turn to a story that has become significantly darker since yesterday's show. The autopsy results for Federica Torzullo, murdered in Anguillara, have been released, and they are difficult to hear. **Il Messaggero** reports that she was stabbed 23 times, but the horror didn't end there: the killer used heavy construction machinery—a bobcat—to manipulate the body in a clumsy, brutal attempt at concealment, resulting in the amputation of a leg.

[newscaster] The brutality has triggered a legal shift. **La Stampa** notes that for one of the first times, prosecutors are formally contesting the specific crime of "femminicidio"—femicide—under new codes, characterizing the act not just as murder, but as a crime of possession and destruction. As the husband, Claudio Carlomagno, remains silent in prison, the community is in shock, with the suspect's own mother resigning from her post as city councilor for security to distance the administration from the tragedy.

[pause]

[newscaster] Moving from the criminal courts to the administrative ones, the political battle over speed limits has exploded in Bologna. The Regional Administrative Court, or TAR, has annulled the city's flagship "City 30" project, which capped speeds at 30 kilometers per hour across most of the urban center.

[cynical] The political reactions are exactly what you would expect. **Libero** and **Il Giornale** are practically popping champagne, framing this as a victory for common sense against "ideological eco-madness," celebrating the court's decision to side with taxi drivers and the center-right opposition. **La Repubblica**, however, gives the floor to the Democratic Party Mayor Matteo Lepore, who is defiant. He argues the project has already saved lives and vows to press on despite the ruling, setting the stage for a long war between the municipality and Matteo Salvini's Ministry of Transport.

[pause]

[energetic] But before we go, let's check in on a billionaire feud that has **Corriere della Sera** entertained.

[cynical] It seems Elon Musk has found a troll equal to his own stature. After Musk posted a poll on X asking if he should buy Ryanair because they won't put his Starlink Wi-Fi on their planes, Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary didn't mince words. He called Musk an "idiot," though he politely added, "a very rich idiot." O'Leary claims passengers don't want to pay for Musk's satellite internet on a short flight; they just want a cheap seat. It is a rare moment where the world's richest man might have actually lost a war of words.

[newscaster] That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.

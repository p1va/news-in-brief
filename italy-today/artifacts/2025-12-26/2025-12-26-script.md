[energetic] Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", I am your host Amelia, Today is Friday 26 and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

[somber] We begin tonight with the lowering of a flag in Turin, marking the definitive end of the Twentieth Century for Italian industry. Maria Sole Agnelli, the sister of the legendary "Avvocato" Gianni Agnelli, has died at the age of 100. While her brother was the flamboyant king of Italy’s post-war economic boom, Maria Sole was the picture of Piedmontese discretion, a trait that the Italian press is mourning deeply today. *La Stampa*, the newspaper historically owned by the Agnelli family, treats this almost as a royal funeral, describing her as the keeper of the family's "genetic memory" and a woman of quiet, steel resolve who steered the family foundation through decades of turbulence.

[newscaster] However, even in death, the fractures in the dynasty are visible. While *Corriere della Sera* and *La Repubblica* focus on her role as a patron of the extraordinary and her grim sadness at outliving her brothers, the Right-wing press is looking at the ruins left behind. *Libero* takes a sharper angle, juxtaposing her dignified passing with what it calls the "Year of Horrors" for her nephew, John Elkann, citing the bitter inheritance battles and the industrial decline of the former Fiat empire. The takeaway across the board is clear: a generation of style and silence has passed, leaving behind a much noisier, and perhaps less capable, group of heirs.

[newscaster] Moving from the history books to the war room, the diplomatic ground is shifting rapidly underneath Europe's feet. *Corriere della Sera* confirms that President Zelensky will meet Donald Trump this Sunday at Mar-a-Lago, a high-stakes summit that will involve European leaders dialing in remotely. This is the moment Rome and Brussels have been waiting for—or fearing.

[cynical] But if you want to understand the narrative battle, you have to look at how the conservative press is framing the run-up to this meeting. *Il Giornale*, always close to the institutional Right, runs a headline suggesting that Moscow is "ready for a deal," but claims that "Kyiv and Europe are trying to sink it." This is a significant pivot, painting the EU—not Russia—as the obstacle to peace. Meanwhile, the Vatican continues to sound the alarm on the moral cost of this conflict. following up on his Christmas message, Pope Leone XIV spoke at the Angelus today, with *Fanpage* noting his bitter observation that those who believe in peace today are "ridiculed and expelled from public discourse." The divide is stark: the Atlanticists are preparing for a negotiation in Florida, while the Populists are already blaming Europe if it fails.

[cynical] Turning our attention to domestic politics, we have a story that proves the oldest rule in Italian bureaucracy: nothing costs as much as trying to save money. Remember the "Taglio dei Parlamentari"? That massive populist victory led by the Five Star Movement to slash the number of MPs and save the taxpayers millions?

[newscaster] Well, the bill has arrived, and the math does not add up. *La Repubblica* and *Adnkronos* report that despite cutting the number of deputies and senators, the operating costs of the Chamber have actually *increased*. *Corriere della Sera* breaks down the numbers, showing that the savings on salaries were instantly swallowed up by increases in bureaucratic overhead and pensions. The opposition is furious, but the irony is palpable. As *Il Fatto Quotidiano* attempts to defend the measure by arguing the costs would have been "even higher" without the cut, the general public is left with the realization that in Rome, the house always wins, and the budget never shrinks.

[energetic] But before we go, here is a quick scan of the rest of the newsstand.

[newscaster] First, a follow-up on yesterday’s weather emergency. *Il Sole Ventiquattro Ore* reports a slight reprieve for Emilia-Romagna. The "Red Alert" has been downgraded to orange in many areas, and evacuees in Ravenna are beginning to return to their homes as the floodwaters recede, though the region remains on high guard.

[energetic] Also, if you thought everyone spent Christmas arguing over politics, the box office says otherwise. *Ansa* reports a record-breaking debut for comedian Checco Zalone’s new film "Buen Camino," which raked in 5.6 million euros in a single day. It is a staggering number that confirms Zalone remains the only person in Italy capable of uniting the North and South in laughter.

[somber] And finally, a note of alarm from across the border. *La Repubblica* and *Il Giornale* are both covering a violent knife attack in the Paris Metro today where three women were wounded. While authorities have ruled out terrorism for now, the incident has dominated the Italian news cycle, playing into existing anxieties about safety in European transit hubs.

[newscaster] That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.

**ITALY TODAY**

Welcome, I am your host Amelia. Today is Saturday, December 20. Today’s episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

**SECTION 1: THE LEAD**

If yesterday the tension in Italy was confined to the hush of parliamentary committee rooms, today it spilled violently into the streets. The lead story across the entire peninsula involves water cannons, tear gas, and burning dumpsters in the elegant center of Turin.

The flashpoint is "Askatasuna," a historic social center—essentially a squatted building occupied by left-wing collectives—which has become a proxy war for national politics. An unauthorized march against the center's eviction turned into urban warfare, with *Corriere della Sera* and *ANSA* confirming at least seven police officers injured and repeated charges by riot squads.

The media coverage depends entirely on which side of the barricade the editors are standing on. For the Right, this is a vindication of their "law and order" platform. *Libero Quotidiano* and *Il Giornale* are ferocious, framing the protesters not as activists but as "violent daddy’s boys" playing at revolution. They are squarely blaming the Democratic Party mayor of Turin, Stefano Lo Russo, for having previously attempted to negotiate a legalization of the space. Deputy Prime Minister Antonio Tajani and League leader Matteo Salvini are practically reading from the same script, demanding "no more tolerance" for what they call illegal fortresses of the extreme Left.

On the other side, *La Repubblica* and *La Stampa*—the latter effectively the hometown paper of the Turin establishment—paint a picture of a city under siege, but they focus heavily on the "tension" and the heavy-handed police response. *Il Fatto Quotidiano* goes further, highlighting the images of students being blasted by water cannons. The takeaway here is political: the government is using the smoke in Turin to accuse the opposition of being soft on crime, while the Left is accusing the government of turning the police force into a political cudgel.

**SECTION 2: THE ROUNDUP**

Moving from the squares back to the Senate, the chaos over the budget law continues, though the weapons there are amendments rather than cobblestones.

Following up on yesterday's report about the pension reform collapse, the government coalition spent Friday fighting over a tax amnesty. *Corriere della Sera* reports a sharp internecine battle over a proposed "condono," or pardon, for past tax evasions. In a rare twist, Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party had to frantically withdraw an amendment that would have reopened tax settlement deadlines, after realizing it was creating too much friction with their coalition partners and Brussels. *Il Sole 24 Ore*, looking past the political theater to the bottom line, notes that while the politicians fight, the taxman is quietly sharpening his knives for 2026: new levies on short-term rentals and e-commerce deliveries are basically locked in.

Meanwhile, the Italian state received a bill from the past that it truly cannot afford. In a ruling that *La Repubblica* calls a "billion-euro sting," the Court of Cassation has ordered the government to repay the telecom giant TIM—formerly Telecom Italia—roughly one billion euros. This dates back to a regulatory fee collected in 1998 that the courts deemed illegitimate. *Il Sole 24 Ore* explains that this is a massive headache for the Ministry of Finance, which now has to find a billion euros in a budget that was already stripped to the bone just to afford 1500-euro vouchers for private schools.

**SECTION 3: THE WRAP-UP**

But before we go, here is a quick scan of the rest of the newsstand:

First, a classic case of Italian bureaucratic surrealism. *La Repubblica* notes that in the national entrance exam for Medical School, roughly 44,000 students managed to hand in their physics tests, sparking a debate on whether the test—or the students—were properly prepared.

Also, the "Epstein Files" released in the US are splashing across Italian front pages today. *Il Fatto Quotidiano* and *La Verità* are digging into the mentions of prominent figures, salaciously detailing the allegations involving Prince Andrew and Bill Clinton, providing plenty of fodder for the anti-establishment press.

And finally, if you are looking for snow this Christmas, you might be out of luck. *Adnkronos* reports that while the weather is turning unstable, a "warm tongue" of air is likely to turn the white Christmas into a wet one for most of the cities, leaving the ski resorts in the Alto Adige worrying about their artificial snow cannons.

That is the state of the country today. I will see you on Monday.

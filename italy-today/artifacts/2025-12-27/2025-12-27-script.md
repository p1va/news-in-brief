[newscaster] We open tonight with a story that has ignited a firestorm across the Italian political spectrum, blurring the lines between humanitarian aid and terrorism financing. In a major operation coordinated by the Genoa prosecutor's office, police have arrested nine people accused of funneling money to Hamas. According to *Corriere della Sera* and *Il Sole Ventiquattro Ore*, the network allegedly transferred over seven million euros under the guise of "Charity for Gaza." The central figure in this investigation is Mohammad Hannoun, an architect based in Genoa who was already on a U.S. blacklist, but who had operated relatively openly in Italy until now.

[cynical] The reaction to these arrests has been instantaneous and polarized. *Il Giornale* and the right-wing press are taking a victory lap, running headlines that connect Hannoun to prominent figures on the Left, specifically mentioning photos of him with former bold-faced names of the Democratic Party and highlighting his proximity to UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese. They view this as vindication that the "Free Palestine" movement in Italy has been infiltrated by bad actors. On the other side of the aisle, *Fanpage* and *Il Fatto Quotidiano* provide the defense, quoting Hannoun’s lawyers and supporters who argue that "solidarity is being criminalized" and insisting that the funds were purely for humanitarian relief in a war zone. Prime Minister Meloni, however, has wasted no time, expressing her "satisfaction" with the operation, signaling that the government intends to take a hard line on where this money is going.

[newscaster] Moving from the courts of Genoa to the halls of the Senate, the government has passed a controversial reform that fundamentally changes how public money is monitored. The Senate has given the definitive green light to the reform of the "Corte dei Conti," the Court of Auditors. essentially, this law limits the liability of public administrators for "grave negligence."

[cynical] The split in the coverage tells you exactly what is at stake. *Il Sole Ventiquattro Ore*, usually the voice of business and pragmatism, simply notes that it is now law. But *Il Fatto Quotidiano* is screaming from the rooftops, quoting magistrates who call this a "dark page" for the republic, arguing that it weakens the responsibility of politicians handling taxpayers' money. *Fanpage* echoes this, suggesting there will now be fewer controls on political spending. The government's defense, supported by *Libero*, is that this will end "bureaucratic fear"—the idea that mayors and officials are too scared of lawsuits to actually sign off on infrastructure projects.

[somber] Turning our gaze internationally, following up on yesterday's report regarding the upcoming peace talks, the price tag for the future of Ukraine is coming into focus, and it is staggering. *Corriere della Sera* reports from President Zelensky’s trip to Canada, where he stated that rebuilding his country will require 800 billion dollars. However, the backdrop to this request is grim. While Russian drones and missiles struck high-rises in Kyiv last night, plunging a million people into darkness, *Adnkronos* reports a new corruption scandal shaking the Ukrainian parliament involving deputies selling votes. It is a dual narrative that the Italian press is struggling to reconcile: the desperate need for aid against the reality of internal graft.

[energetic] But before we go, here is a quick scan of the rest of the newsstand.

[somber] First, a disturbing report from the south. *Corriere della Sera* and *Libero* are covering a brutal attack in the province of Salerno, where a local Mayor, Carmine Siano, was beaten with a baton outside his home by a hooded assailant. He has suffered fractures and the amputation of a finger. It is a stark reminder of the physical risks local administrators still face in certain parts of the country.

[newscaster] Also, nature is putting on a show in Sicily. *AGI* and *La Repubblica* report that Mount Etna has surged back into activity, spitting fountains of lava up to 400 meters high. The airport in Catania is on alert, but for now, the spectacle remains a visual one rather than a logistical nightmare.

[cynical] And finally, because no Italian news cycle is complete without a celebrity real estate feud, *Il Fatto Quotidiano* and *Libero* are relishing a dispute involving singer Eros Ramazzotti. His neighbor in Milan has sued him for 200,000 euros, claiming that renovations in the singer's apartment caused the neighbor's ceiling to collapse. Ramazzotti’s team calls the version "incomplete," but the press is enjoying the domestic drama of a superstar dealing with the same condominium headaches as everyone else.

[newscaster] That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.

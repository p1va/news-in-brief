Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", today is Saturday 24 and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

The Alps have turned into a diplomatic wall. **Il Giornale** screams "Shame" as the Swiss judiciary releases the owner of the club where 40 people died, prompting Rome to take the drastic step of recalling its ambassador. From Justice to the streets, the shadow of American policing looms over Italy: **La Repubblica** connects a brutal killing by federal agents in Minneapolis to fears of their presence at the upcoming Milan-Cortina Olympics. In the political backrooms, **Il Fatto Quotidiano** spotlights a controversial guest at the Ministry of Transport, claiming Matteo Salvini is building a "Black International" by hosting British extremist Tommy Robinson. And while bombs fall on Kiev, **La Verità** reports on the quiet, cynical trading of land for peace taking place in Abu Dhabi. But we begin with the institutional clash between Rome and Bern.

Following up on yesterday's report regarding the Crans-Montana tragedy, the indignation has hardened into a full-scale diplomatic crisis. **Corriere della Sera** reports that Italy has recalled its Ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado, for "consultations"—a move usually reserved for hostile nations, not friendly neighbors. The trigger was the release on bail of Jacques Moretti, the owner of the "Constellation" club, after a mysterious "wealthy friend" paid the 200,000 Swiss Francs bond. Moretti is now sitting comfortably in his villa, a fact that has sent the Meloni government into a fury.

The narrative split here is sharp and reveals two very different concepts of justice. On the right, **Libero** and **Il Giornale** are acting as the government's megaphone, framing this as a class war where money buys freedom and the Swiss are indifferent to Italian dead. They amplify Foreign Minister Tajani’s claim that the investigation is "leaking from all sides" and that the release is an "insult to the victims." **La Verità** adds a layer of suspicion, suggesting Moretti might be a "frontman" for larger interests, making his release even more suspect.

However, the Swiss pushback is firm. **Il Sole 24 Ore** and **La Stampa** report the icy response from Swiss President Guy Parmelin, who reminded Rome of a basic democratic concept: the separation of powers. "Politics must not interfere with justice," he warned. **La Repubblica** tries to play the mediator, noting that while the emotional wound is real, the Swiss legal code allows for bail if flight risk is contained. The takeaway is dangerous: Meloni is flexing diplomatic muscle to show she defends Italians abroad, but she is risking a structural rift with a key economic partner over a judicial decision she cannot change.

Meanwhile, a darker debate about security and alliances is brewing, linking the streets of Minneapolis to the corridors of Rome. **La Repubblica** and **La Stampa** are covering the killing of a man in Minneapolis by an agent of ICE—the American agency responsible for immigration control—framing it as a sign of the brutal methods likely to increase under the Trump administration. But the story has jumped the ocean because of a rumor that ICE agents might be deployed to help secure the Milan-Cortina Olympics.

Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi tried to put out the fire, stating "it doesn't result to us" that ICE is coming, but his addendum—that "it would be normal" for US delegations to bring their own security—has enraged the Left. **Il Fatto Quotidiano** and the **Green Alliance (AVS)** are up in arms, asking if Italy is importing "repressive models" and militarizing the Olympics.

The controversy deepens when viewed through the lens of Matteo Salvini’s agenda. **Il Fatto** and **Repubblica** are scathing about Salvini hosting Tommy Robinson, the British far-right figure with a criminal record, at the Ministry. **Fanpage** calls it a provocation, noting Robinson’s history of fraud and violence. The synthesis here is clear: The government considers the "Trump/Hard Right" approach to security as the new standard, while the opposition sees it as an erosion of civil liberties, whether it’s an ICE agent in the snow or a British extremist in the Ministry.

Turning to the geopolitical table, while the rhetoric is loud, the real moves are silent. **La Verità** and **Il Giornale** provide coverage of the trilateral talks beginning in Abu Dhabi between Russia, the US, and Ukraine. The headline is grim but pragmatic: "The Donbass is at the center." The narrative from the Right-wing press is that the "Land for Peace" deal—Ukraine giving up territory to stop the war—is no longer a taboo but the inevitable conclusion. **Il Fatto Quotidiano** cynically notes that while Zelensky publicly refuses to "gift territory," the negotiations are proceeding exactly as the new Trump administration privately demands.

But before we go, a note on the culture wars hitting the slopes. The announcement that the rapper Ghali—known for his pro-Palestinian stance—will have a role in the Olympic transition ceremony has triggered the Jewish community and the institutional Right. **Libero** reports that nine Israeli athletes will already require Mossad protection and secret lodging during the games, and warns that Ghali’s presence on stage could turn a moment of "universal brotherhood" into a political rally against Israel. It seems not even the snow is neutral ground anymore.

That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.

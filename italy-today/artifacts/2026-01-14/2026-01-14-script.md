[energetic] Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", I am your host Amelia, Today is Wednesday 14 and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

[newscaster] The "Pandoro-gate", the scandal that arguably dismantled the undisputed reign of Italy's influencer queen, has effectively ended in a procedural whimper rather than a bang. Today, a Milanese judge declared a "non-place to proceed" against Chiara Ferragni regarding the charity fraud allegations linked to her holiday cakes and Easter eggs. **AGI** and **Corriere Della Sera** report the legal technicality behind the decision: the judge ruled that the fraud was not "aggravated," meaning it could only be prosecuted if a victim filed a formal complaint. Since the consumer association Codacons withdrew their complaint—after Ferragni paid a substantial settlement—the case is extinguished.

[cynical] Naturally, the interpretation of this verdict depends entirely on which paper you buy. **La Repubblica** focuses on the influencer's emotional release, quoting her tearful "The nightmare is over" and her gratitude to the followers who stayed. However, **Il Fatto Quotidiano** acts as the rainy cloud at the parade, sharply reminding readers that this is not an acquittal on the merits of honesty, but a loophole purchased with a large check to make the accusers go away. **Il Giornale** takes a middle road, noting that while she avoided a criminal record, the "loot" of her credibility and follower count has been irretrievably lost.

[somber] Turning our eyes back to the Middle East, the situation in Iran is deteoriating rapidly. Following up on yesterday's report, **La Repubblica** is now circulating sources from Reuters suggesting a possible American military intervention within the next 24 hours, as Washington evacuates personnel from bases in Qatar. The rhetoric is escalating on both sides; **Corriere Della Sera** highlights a direct message from Donald Trump telling Iranians to "stand firm" because help is coming, while **La Verità** reports on the gruesome toll of the repression, with opposition sources now claiming thousands dead in the streets. **Fanpage** notes the domestic political fallout, with the Italian Right now championing the Iranian protesters' rights, while accusing the Left of being embarrassingly hesitant to support a revolt that aligns with Donald Trump's foreign policy.

[newscaster] Moving from international conflicts to the institutional war here in Rome, the government has officially set the dates for the controversial referendum on Justice Reform: Italians will vote on March 22nd and 23rd. The core of the issue is the separation of career paths for judges and prosecutors. **Il Giornale** defends the move, carrying Justice Minister Carlo Nordio’s argument that the current system protects incompetent magistrates who "cannot be fired."

[cynical] The opposition, however, smells a rat. **La Stampa** and **Il Fatto Quotidiano** are amplifying the voices of the magistrates' union and the Left, who claim the government is rushing the vote to catch the "NO" campaign unprepared. They argue this isn't about efficiency, but about bringing the judiciary under political control. **Il Sole 24 Ore** notes that the Administrative Court (TAR) has already rejected an attempt to block the date, clearing the way for what promises to be a brutal spring campaign season.

[energetic] But before we go, here is a quick scan of the rest of the newsstand.

[somber] First, the political world is in mourning today for the death of Valeria Fedeli at age 76. **Corriere Della Sera** and **La Repubblica** pay tribute to the former Education Minister and fierce trade unionist, with condolences pouring in from across the spectrum, from Prime Minister Meloni to PD leader Elly Schlein.

[newscaster] Also, if you are driving in Rome tomorrow, lift your foot off the gas. **AGI** reports that starting Thursday, the capital's historic center officially becomes a "Zone 30." The speed limit drops to 30 kilometers per hour to curve accidents, a move **Il Sole 24 Ore** notes follows similar crackdowns in Bologna and Milan.

[cynical] And finally, speaking of real estate, Donald Trump is shopping again. **L'Unità** and **La Repubblica** report that the US President is doubling down on his desire to buy Greenland, calling it essential for his "Golden Dome" missile defense system. While the Danish Prime Minister says the island "belongs to its people," the US is already reportedly increasing military presence there.

[newscaster] That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.

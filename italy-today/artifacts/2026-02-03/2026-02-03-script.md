Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", today is Tuesday 03 and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

We begin with the blitz. Russian missiles have pounded Ukraine’s energy grid in the heaviest attack of the year, just as President Zelensky warns that without power, negotiation tables mean nothing. In Rome, the government’s controversial Security Decree, designed to crack down on street protests, has been delayed until Thursday to iron out constitutional concerns. Tragedy strikes Naples, where a twenty-two-year-old woman, Ilenia Musella, was stabbed to death, allegedly by family members, sparking yet another debate on domestic violence that so far remains strictly local. On the financial front, despite the political noise, the Treasury placed a new fifteen-year BTP bond with record demand exceeding one hundred fifty billion euro, proving the markets are currently ignoring the Palazzo Chigi drama. And finally, the Olympic machine is whirring to life, with President Mattarella in Milan calling for a global truce, while Lindsey Vonn announces she will ski with a broken cruciate ligament—a metaphor, perhaps, for the resilience, or the recklessness, of the entire event.

But the story that is actually shaking the foundations of the ruling coalition is the divorce between Matteo Salvini and the General.

Roberto Vannacci has officially left the League. The man who wrote "The World Upside Down" and brought half a million preferenze to Salvini’s party in the European elections has decided the vessel is too small for his ego. He has launched his own movement, "Futuro Nazionale," and declared he is walking alone. The spin on this rupture defines the current state of the Italian Right.

For the establishment Right and the League’s loyalists, the narrative is one of betrayal and dishonor. *Libero* and *Il Giornale* are running thick with quotes from a "deluded and bitter" Salvini, who reminds the General that "a soldier never abandons his post." *Libero* emphasizes that the League opened its doors when everyone else was cancelling Vannacci, framing his exit as political opportunism devoid of loyalty. *Il Giornale* goes a step further, subtly mocking his new manifesto and warning that the group of "Patriots" in Europe has already expelled him because membership requires a party card, not just a personality cult.

However, cross the aisle to *La Repubblica* and *Il Fatto Quotidiano*, and the picture changes from betrayal to implosion. *Repubblica* highlights the schadenfreude of the old Northern League guard, quoting Mario Borghezio who cheers for Vannacci, claiming Salvini has "denatured" the party and deserves the beating. *Il Fatto Quotidiano* asks the only question that matters for the stability of the government: "Who goes with him?" They report that at least three MPs are already considered "Vannacciani" and could follow him out the door. The takeaway here is structural: the League is bleeding support to its right, and if Vannacci siphons off the extremist vote, Salvini’s leverage within the Meloni government—already fragile—could snap entirely.

Meanwhile, moving from the corridors of the party headquarters to the streets of Turin, the aftershocks of Saturday’s riots are dictating the legislative agenda in Rome.

Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi reported to the Chamber regarding the clashes with the Askatasuna social center. His language was stark. As reported by *Il Giornale* and *La Verità*, Piantedosi described the violence not as a protest, but as a strategy of "urban warfare" reminiscent of the Years of Lead, accusing opposition politicians who attended the march of offering "impunity" to delinquents. The government is using this to fast-track a new Security Decree, which includes a controversial "preventive detention" for those deemed dangerous to public order before crimes are even committed.

The opposition, naturally, sees it differently. *La Repubblica* and the Democratic Party accuse the government of using the riots as a pretext for an authoritarian turn, criminalizing dissent rather than addressing the root causes of social anger. But the most interesting detail comes from *La Verità*, which notes the decree was delayed not because of the opposition, but because of doubts from the Quirinale and Forza Italia regarding the constitutionality of banning people from protests without a trial. The government is walking a tightrope between demanding law and order and violating civil liberties.

Turning to the economy, while the politicians fight over street battles, the industrial fabric of the country is quietly being redrawn abroad.

Deep in the business pages, a story from *Il Corriere della Sera* contrasts sharply with a report from *Il Manifesto*. *Corriere* profiles a Turin-based component manufacturer for the auto industry that is opening a factory in Algeria. The paper frames this as a smart expansion strategy to serve Stellantis, which is growing its footprint in North Africa. It’s presented as Italian ingenuity going global. *Il Manifesto*, however, strips away the gloss, calling it what the unions fear it is: delocalization. While Rome argues about "Made in Italy" and creates commemorative days for pasta, the actual supply chain of the automotive sector—the engine of the north—is drifting across the Mediterranean to chase lower costs, leaving the "Motor City" of Turin increasingly empty.

But before we go, a moment of divine comedy from the capital.

Visitors to the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Lucina in Rome have noticed something peculiar about a newly restored fresco of an angel. As *L’Unità* and *Corriere della Sera* report with raised eyebrows, the cherub bears an uncanny, photorealistic resemblance to Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. The Vicariate has hurriedly issued a statement saying, quote, "surely the original didn't look like that," while the noblewoman who funded the restoration claims she "doesn't remember." Whether it’s a miracle, a prank by the restorer, or a sycophantic homage, it is the perfect metaphor for a country where politics eventually paints over everything—even the sacred.

I will see you tomorrow.

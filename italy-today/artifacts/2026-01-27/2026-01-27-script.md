Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", today is Tuesday 27 and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

Let’s get straight to the headlines. The ground is still moving in Sicily, where the Niscemi landslide has turned into a full-blown catastrophe with fifteen hundred people displaced; in Rome, the Senate marked Holocaust Remembrance Day, but not without political friction as Liliana Segre warned against using Gaza to erase the Shoah; meanwhile, a diplomatic crisis has opened with Tehran after Iran summoned the Italian ambassador over Minister Tajani’s comments on the Revolutionary Guards; in the Alps, a breakthrough in the Crans-Montana tragedy as Switzerland finally agrees to a joint investigation; and finally, a violent flashpoint in Milan, where a police shooting in the drug-dealing district of Rogoredo has reignited the debate on security and self-defense.

But we begin in Milan, where the intersection of drug crime, immigration, and police rules of engagement has resulted in a death that is already polarizing the country along predictable political lines.

Yesterday evening, in the notorious "boschetto" of Rogoredo—Milan’s open-air drug market—a police officer in plain clothes shot and killed a 28-year-old Moroccan national, Abderrahim Mansouri. The dynamics are the subject of intense scrutiny by the judiciary. According to **Il Giornale** and **Libero**, the officer fired in legitimate self-defense after the suspect, described as a "boss of the drug trade" with a history of resisting arrest, pointed a gun at him in the dark. That gun, however, turned out to be a replica—a fake weapon without a red cap. For the Right-wing press and Matteo Salvini, who immediately stated "I stand with the policeman without ifs or buts," this is a clear-cut case of an agent forced to make a split-second decision against a dangerous criminal.

However, the narrative shifts significantly when you read **Fanpage** and **La Repubblica**. They highlight that the officer is now under investigation for voluntary homicide, a necessary technical step, but one that underscores the gravity of the act. **Fanpage** challenges the triumphalist narrative of the city administration, noting that despite Mayor Beppe Sala’s claims of cleaning up Rogoredo, the area remains a "Far West." The center-left is caught in a difficult position: trying to support state security while questioning the use of lethal force against a man holding a toy gun. The takeaway here is a renewed clash over the "Safety Decree" and the legal protections afforded to officers, with the Government pushing to shield agents from what they call "automatic indictments."

Moving from the urban crisis in the North to the geological crisis in the South, the situation in Niscemi has escalated from an emergency to an existential threat for the town.

As we reported yesterday, a landslide is consuming the Sicilian hillside, but today **Corriere della Sera** and **Il Sole 24 Ore** report that the fracture has widened to four kilometers. The number of evacuees has jumped to 1,500, and the head of Civil Protection, Fabio Ciciliano, was blunt: "The entire hill is collapsing." But the physical collapse has triggered a financial battle. **La Repubblica** and **La Stampa** are amplifying a specific political demand led by PD Secretary Elly Schlein, who visited the site today. Her argument is fiscal: she is demanding that the government divert the billions earmarked for the controversial Bridge over the Straits of Messina to immediately fund the hydrogeological safety of the island. It is a potent political weapon, pitting a future, theoretical mega-project against a present, tangible disaster where citizens are watching their homes slide into the valley.

Turning to the diplomatic front, Italy finds itself walking a tightrope between two very different international disputes.

First, there is high tension with Tehran. **AGI** and **Il Messaggero** report that the Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned the Italian Ambassador, Paola Amadei, to protest violently against Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani. Tajani had proposed listing the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps—the Pasdaran—as a terrorist organization. While the government holds firm, **Il Giornale** frames this as Italy finally showing a spine against the Ayatollahs, despite the economic risks.

Simultaneously, there is a rare diplomatic win regarding the Swiss border. Following the tragedy in Crans-Montana, where Italian nationals died in a nightclub fire, the Swiss government has capitulated to Italian pressure. **Libero** frames this explicitly as a victory for Premier Meloni, noting that Bern has agreed to "joint investigative teams"—a request previously snubbed. The Ambassador, who had been recalled to Rome in protest, will likely return, but the message from Palazzo Chigi is clear: Italy is demanding extraterritorial oversight when its citizens are victims of negligence abroad, a muscular stance that is playing well with the government's base.

But before we go, a look at the Venice Lagoon, where an invasion of a different kind is worrying scientists. **Il Giornale** reports on the spread of the *Mnemiopsis leidyi*, commonly known as the "sea walnut." It looks like a jellyfish, but it’s a ctenophore, and while it doesn't sting humans, it is a voracious predator of plankton and fish larvae. It’s an invasive species that has already devastated ecosystems in the Black Sea, and its proliferation in Venice is being called "worse than the blue crab." It is a quiet, biological reminder that while we worry about political borders, the environmental ones are changing faster than we can legislate.

That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.

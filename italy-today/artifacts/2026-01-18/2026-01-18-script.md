[energetic] Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", today is Sunday 18 and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

[newscaster] We begin with the diplomatic frost settlng over the Atlantic, as Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni attempts to navigate the treacherous waters between Donald Trump’s protectionism and European solidarity. Following the US President's threat to impose 10% tariffs on European nations that deployed troops to Greenland, Meloni, speaking from Seoul, tried to play the role of the mediator. She publicly stated that the tariffs would be "an error," but—in a move designed to soothe Washington—suggested that the real problem was a "misunderstanding" caused by unclear messaging from Brussels.

[cynical] The reaction in the Italian press breaks down exactly as you might expect, with the Prime Minister acting as a Rorschach test for political bias. **La Repubblica** and the opposition leaders are scathing, accusing Meloni of "servility" toward the US, noting that while Spain and Germany are preparing for a trade war, Rome is making excuses for Trump’s aggression. **Libero**, on the other hand, hails Meloni’s caution as "statemanlike," arguing that she is the only adult in the room trying to de-escalate while the European Left declares war on the White House. Meanwhile, **La Stampa** highlights the absurdity of the situation, noting a NATO paradox where a US Vice Admiral might be technically in charge of defending the very island Trump is threatening economically.

[somber] Following up on yesterday’s report regarding the murder of 18-year-old Youssef inside a classroom in La Spezia, the grief has rapidly transformed into a fierce political battle over school security. Education Minister Giuseppe Valditara visited the city today, embracing the victim's family, but his proposal to introduce metal detectors in "at-risk" schools has ignited a firestorm.

[newscaster] The lines are drawn sharply. **Libero** and **Il Giornale** are running full-throated defenses of the Minister, framing the metal detector proposal as a necessary response to "50 years of lax values" and accusing the Left of being soft on youth violence. Conversely, **La Stampa** and **Il Fatto Quotidiano** report on the anger of students and parents who protested outside the morgue with signs reading "The school is complicit." For the unions and the opposition, the government is looking for a repressive "spot decree" rather than addressing the social unraveling that leads a student to bring a knife to class.

[somber] Turning to a grim discovery in the province of Rome, the search for Federica Torzullo has ended in tragedy. Ten days after vanishing from her home in Anguillara, the 41-year-old woman’s body was found this morning, buried under two meters of earth on the grounds of her husband’s company.

[newscaster] **Corriere Della Sera** and the major agencies report that her husband, Claudio Carlomagno, has been transferred to prison, with prosecutors citing "insurmountable" evidence, including blood traces found in his car and on his work clothes. This story has dominated the Sunday headlines, pushing aside political maneuvering to focus on yet another femicide that has shaken the capital region. **Il Messaggero** notes the grim detail that she was identified initially by the bracelets she was wearing, as investigators work to reconstruct a crime that appears to have been brutally premeditated.

[energetic] But before we go, here is a quick scan of the rest of the newsstand.

[somber] First, the world of business and sport is mourning Rocco Commisso. The President of Fiorentina and media tycoon passed away at 76. **La Nazione** and the sports press are eulogizing him as a passionate, self-made man who poured his heart—and his finances—into Italian football, with the team dedicating their victory today in Bologna to his memory.

[newscaster] Also, public order issues spilled onto the A1 highway today. **La Repubblica** reports that 200 Ultras from Roma and Fiorentina clashed in a violent, organized brawl near Bologna, armed with clubs and chains, blocking traffic and terrifying motorists in scenes reminiscent of the worst years of football hooliganism.

[cynical] And finally, the ghost of the Crans-Montana fire is haunting Rome’s nightlife. **Il Sole 24 Ore** reports that police have placed seals on the legendary "Piper Club," the historic discotheque that defined the Swinging Sixties in Rome. Authorities cited safety violations and overcrowding, a clear sign that the clampdown on nightlife safety is intensifying across the peninsula.

[newscaster] That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.

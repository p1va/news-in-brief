Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", today is Saturday 07 and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

We begin with the blitz. The manufacturing crisis has deepened significantly; *Stellantis* creates a new shockwave by cancelling the "Gigafactory" project in Termoli, a move *Il Fatto Quotidiano* describes as the definitive end of the industrial dream for the South. In Milan, the diplomatic dance continues as Prime Minister Meloni hosted U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance for a visit to the Last Supper and a bilateral meeting, with *La Verità* emphasizing a shared "sovereignist" vision despite the friction over tariffs. On the Russian front, following yesterday’s assassination attempt on Major General Alekseyev, Moscow is officially accusing Kiev of terrorism, raising the stakes just as Zelensky suggests—according to *La Repubblica*—that the US wants the war over by June. Finally, the first gold medal has arrived for Italy at the Milan-Cortina Games thanks to skater Francesca Lollobrigida, but the celebration is being drowned out by a distinct smell of burning rubber coming from the streets of Milan.

The main story today, however, is a constitutional clash that is turning into a race against time.

The "Justice War" we reported on yesterday has mutated overnight into a chaotic institutional standoff. President Mattarella has signed the decree confirming the date of the referendum on the separation of judicial careers for March 22nd and 23rd. On paper, the government has won its timeline. However, the victory comes with a poison pill administered by the Court of Cassation. The high court ruled that the referendum question on the ballot must be rewritten to explicitly list every single article of the Constitution being modified—a technicality that lengthens the text and makes it look far more daunting to the average voter.

The spin war is ferocious. *Libero* and *Il Giornale* are screaming "Golpe dei giudici" (Judicial Coup), accusing the "red togas" of trying to sabotage the vote by confusing the electorate or forcing a delay through bureaucracy. They frame this as the judiciary trying to save its own caste system from popular will. On the flip side, *La Repubblica* and *L'Unità* interview opposition leaders who praise the court’s decision as a victory for transparency, arguing the government was trying to pass a "blind reform" without explaining the constitutional vandalism involved.

The takeaway here is structural: The government is forcing a showdown to break the power of the magistrates before the European elections fully ramp up. By confirming the March date despite the Cassation’s hurdles, Meloni is signaling she is willing to bulldoze through procedural norms. But with the ballot text now looking like a legal manual, the government's challenge will be to keep the voters' emotional engagement high enough to actually tick "Yes."

Moving from the halls of justice to the chaos on the rails, the Olympics have started with a split-screen reality that exposes the Country's deep fractures.

On one screen, you have Francesca Lollobrigida winning Italy's first gold in speed skating, a moment *Corriere della Sera* celebrates as pure national pride. On the other screen, you accept the reality described by the Interior Ministry as "sabotage." High-speed rail cables were severed in Bologna, and an arson attack hit a cabin in Pesaro, paralyzing train traffic across the spine of Italy on the opening weekend of the Games. Deputy Premier Matteo Salvini, quoted across all agency feeds, has branded this "terrorism" linked to anarchist groups targeting the Olympics.

The narrative divide is stark. *La Verità* and *Il Giornale* connect the sabotage directly to the anti-Olympic protests in Milan, where 5,000 people clashed with police in the Corvetto district, throwing firecrackers and facing water cannons. They frame the protesters as enemies of the state ruining Italy's moment in the sun. Conversely, *Il Fatto Quotidiano* and *Fanpage* focus on the local anger, interviewing protesters who claim the Games are an ecological and economic disaster for the city, arguing that the "sabotage" narrative is being used to criminalize legitimate dissent. The "Italian Miracle" of the Games is currently sharing the stage with burning barricades.

Meanwhile, a different kind of sabotage is happening inside the government coalition.

General Roberto Vannacci has officially pulled the trigger. As reported by *Adnkronos*, the controversial figure has registered the statute for his new party, "Futuro Nazionale," and has already poached two MPs from Matteo Salvini’s League. This is a direct shot at the heart of Salvini’s leadership. While *La Stampa* gleefully details the panic within the League, noting that Salvini is "bleeding form the right," the reaction from the Brothers of Italy camp is coolly dismissive. *La Verità* quotes Arianna Meloni saying they are "not worried," a subtle indication that the Prime Minister might not mind seeing her coalition partner weakened by a new rival on the far right.

But before we go, we must address the national pastime that unites Italians more than gold medals or pizza: complaining about the state broadcaster, RAI.

While the ceremony at San Siro was visually spectacular, the commentary provided by RAI journalist Paolo Petrecca has triggered a nationwide meltdown. Viewers were treated to a comedy of errors, including mixing up singer Matilda De Angelis with Mariah Carey, and—in a moment destined for meme history—confusing an olympic official with President Mattarella’s daughter. *La Repubblica* and social media are tearing the "Tele-Meloni" coverage apart, calling it amateurish and embarrassing. In a country where style is everything, getting the names wrong at your own party is a sin not easily forgiven.

I will see you tomorrow.

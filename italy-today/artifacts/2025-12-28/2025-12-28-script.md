[energetic] Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", I am your host Amelia, Today is Sunday 28 and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

[newscaster] Following up on yesterday’s top story regarding the Hamas financing network in Genoa, the situation has escalated from a judicial inquiry into a full-blown political brawl. The release of wiretaps involving the key suspect, Mohammad Hannoun, has poured gasoline on the fire. According to *Corriere Della Sera* and *Fanpage*, the intercepts reveal a chilling distinction made by the suspects: "We sacrifice with money, they sacrifice with blood." Investigators have seized over one million euros in cash, hidden inside walls, further cementing the prosecution's case that this was not simple charity.

[cynical] The political fallout, however, is where the narrative really diverges. The Right is using this to hammer the institutional Left. *La Verità* and *Libero* are on the offensive, demanding answers from Democratic Party leader Elly Schlein and publishing lists of "friends of the terrorist," specifically targeting the Mayors of Milan and Bologna who had previously allowed Hannoun to speak at public events. *Il Giornale* goes a step further, accusing the Left of a "guilty silence" reminiscent of the Years of Lead. Conversely, *Il Fatto Quotidiano* frames this as a chaotic witch hunt in the Chamber, focusing on the parliamentary shouting matches where Right-wing deputies are accused of instrumentalizing a judicial investigation to smear the entire opposition. The takeaway is clear: the consensus on counter-terrorism is fracturing under the weight of partisan blame.

[somber] Moving from the toxicity of politics to the passing of a cultural titan, the Italian press is united in mourning Brigitte Bardot, who has died at the age of 91. While she was a French icon, her connection to Italy was profound. *Corriere Della Sera* and *La Repubblica* dedicate extensive coverage to "B.B.," painting her as the eternal symbol of rebellion and beauty who practically invented the paparazzi era in Rome and Capri.

[newscaster] Yet, the obituaries are not entirely hagiographic. The coverage reflects the complexity of her later life. *La Stampa* and *Fanpage* do not shy away from her controversial far-right political shifts or her difficult private life, highlighting a resurfaced interview where she brutally described her son as a "tumor" she preferred not to have. *Il Giornale*, specifically, focuses on her animal rights legacy, noting that for many Italians, she morphed from a sex symbol into a "Marianne of the animals," a crusader who spent half her life fighting for those who had no voice.

[newscaster] Turning to the international stage, the "peace deal" anxiety we discussed yesterday has moved to Florida. President Zelensky is at Mar-a-Lago to meet Donald Trump, but the atmosphere described by the Italian press is tense. *Adnkronos* and *Il Sole Ventiquattro Ore* report that Trump held a "productive" phone call with Vladimir Putin just moments before receiving the Ukrainian leader, a sequence of events that *Corriere Della Sera* suggests could be a "trap" for Kyiv.

[cynical] The spin here is fascinatingly divergent. *Libero*, representing the populist Right, claims Prime Minister Meloni is the one acting as the "alarm bell" for Europe, urging unity before the American administration changes course. *La Verità*, however, is far more skeptical of Zelensky, highlighting corruption scandals back in Ukraine to suggest that the "blank check" era is rightly coming to an end. The Italian media is bracing its audience for a 2026 where Europe might be left holding the bill.

[energetic] But before we go, here is a quick scan of the rest of the newsstand.

[somber] First, a tragic story of healthcare failure dominating *Il Fatto Quotidiano* and *Messaggero*. In Campobasso, a mother and her 15-year-old daughter have died of suspected food poisoning after a Christmas meal. The outrage stems from the fact that they had reportedly visited the emergency room twice, only to be discharged before collapsing.

[newscaster] Also, the Budget Law is inching toward the finish line amid chaos. *La Repubblica* reports on the "bagarre" in the Chamber, where the opposition is furious that the debate has been stifled by the government to force a vote before the New Year. It is the usual end-of-year legislative panic, but with higher tempers than usual.

[cynical] And finally, an update on the "Family in the Woods" saga that fascinated readers last week. *Libero* and *Corriere* report that the Finnish family, who tried to live off-grid in Sicily only to be reported to social services, creates a divide. While the Right calls them "neo-rural" ideologues at war with judges, supporters argue they were just living a normal life, proving that in Italy, even how you raise your kids in the forest is a matter of national debate.

[newscaster] That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.

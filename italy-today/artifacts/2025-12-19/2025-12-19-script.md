**ITALY TODAY**

Welcome, I am your host Amelia. Today is Friday, December 19. Today's episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

**SECTION 1: THE LEAD**

Following up on yesterday's report, the cracks in the government coalition we mentioned have turned into a landslide. If yesterday was about a tactical retreat on university pension buybacks, today is about a strategic surrender on the entire pension front. During a chaotic night in the Budget Committee, the government majority effectively deleted its own proposals to reform the pension system for 2026.

According to *Il Sole 24 Ore*—the sober voice of the business community—a full-blown government crisis was "avoided by a whisper." To keep the peace between the League and Forza Italia, the executive scrapped the controversial changes to the "TFR" severance pay and the tightening of early retirement rules. Effectively, the government has chosen stability over reform, opting to leave things exactly as they are rather than risk a vote that could shatter the alliance.

The reaction this morning is a perfect study in Italian media spin. *La Repubblica* and the Democratic Party are claiming victory, with opposition leader Elly Schlein declaring that "the majority is broken" and arguing that the government is paralyzed by infighting. Conversely, the right-wing papers are looking elsewhere. *Libero Quotidiano* and *Il Giornale* completely ignore the pension failure, focusing instead on the one victory the coalition managed to secure: a new 1,500 euro "voucher" for families sending children to private, parochial schools. For the Right, this is a triumph for educational freedom; for the rest of the country, it looks like a consolation prize in a budget law that has largely decided to do nothing at all.

**SECTION 2: THE ROUNDUP**

Moving from the paralysis in Parliament to the cold case that never sleeps...

There has been a significant, albeit mysterious, development in the disappearance of Emanuela Orlandi—the Vatican citizen who vanished into thin air 42 years ago. *Corriere della Sera* and *Adnkronos* report that the Rome Prosecutor’s office has formally placed a new person under investigation. While the suspect’s name remains shielded, the charge is "false information to a public prosecutor." This suggests investigators believe someone is still lying to protect the secrets of 1983. While *La Stampa* highlights this as a "colpo di scena"—a plot twist—veteran observers remain skeptical. In Italy, new investigations into Orlandi usually signal the beginning of a new mystery, rather than the end of the old one.

Meanwhile, prepare your wallets if you are planning a trip to the capital. After months of speculation, it is official: looking at the Trevi Fountain will complicate your logistics, and eventually, your bank account. *AGI* and *Il Post* report that starting February 1st, access to the fountain’s lower basin will be restricted and ticketed at two euros. Mayor Roberto Gualtieri argues this is about crowd control rather than revenue, a view supported by *Il Messaggero’s* local reporting. However, critics fear this is the turning point where Rome ceases to be a city and officially becomes a theme park.

**SECTION 3: THE WRAP-UP**

But before we go, here are a few other stories making the rounds:

First, a major shakeup in the Italian media landscape. *La Repubblica* reports that the Del Vecchio family—heirs to the Luxottica eyewear fortune—has acquired a 30% stake in *Il Giornale*. It is a fascinating move: a family historically aligned with liberal finance buying into the house organ of the institutional Right.

Also, Italian fashion continues its eastward migration. *Corriere della Sera* notes that the luxury sneaker brand "Golden Goose" has been sold to a consortium including funds from Hong Kong and Singapore for 2.5 billion euros.

And finally, tensions are spiking in the Mediterranean. *La Verità* and *Repubblica* both report that a Russian oil tanker was struck, allegedly by Ukraine, in waters surprisingly close to Sicily. The war, it seems, is no longer just in the Black Sea.

That is the state of the country today. I will see you on Monday.

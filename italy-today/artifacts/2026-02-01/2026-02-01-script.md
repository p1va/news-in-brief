Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", today is Sunday, February 1st and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

We begin with the blitz.

The tragedy in Niscemi deepens as the earth continues to move; *La Repubblica* reports that drones have identified further detachments from the hillside, with the local bishop warning that the town cannot remain inert while citizens lose their homes. In Rome, the tourist experience changes tomorrow morning; *ANSA* confirms that the 2-euro ticket to view the Trevi Fountain goes into effect, a measure the municipality claims is necessary to manage the "overtourism" choking the capital. In the north, the mountains are treacherous; *Il Messaggero* reports a fatal day in the Alps, with avalanches in Friuli claiming the life of a ski-alpinist and burying several others, prompting severe warnings from the Alpine Rescue. On the geopolitical stage, *La Stampa* highlights the tension radiating from Washington to Teheran, noting that the Iranian parliament has designated European armies as "terrorist organizations" in a tit-for-tat retaliation against EU sanctions. And finally, *Il Sole Ventiquattro Ore* offers a rare moment of unity between industry and government, noting that Confindustria is celebrating the S&P ratings outlook upgrade as proof that Italian manufacturing remains resilient despite the German recession.

But the main story today is the political fallout from the urban warfare in Turin.

If yesterday was about the smoke and the tear gas, today is about the political shrapnel. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni travelled personally to the Molinette Hospital in Turin to visit the police officer who was surrounded and beaten—an image that has dominated the Sunday news cycle. As reported by *Corriere della Sera*, the Premier did not mince words, rejecting the term "demonstration" and reclassifying the event as "attempted murder." This visit has emboldened the Government to launch a full-scale offensive not just against the anarchists, but against the institutional Left.

The narrative divide is absolute. *Il Giornale* and *Libero* are ferociously targeting the "Alleanza Verdi e Sinistra" (AVS), specifically Deputy Marco Grimaldi, who was present in the piazza. *Libero* frames the left's presence as a de facto endorsement of "Red Squadrismo," demanding the resignation of local councilors who marched alongside those throwing paper bombs. They are using the graphic video of the officer being beaten with a hammer as proof that the opposition is flirting with 1970s-style terrorism.

On the other side, the defense is fractured. While *La Stampa*—the voice of the Turin establishment—acknowledges the "guerrilla" tactics and the fear gripping the city, *Il Manifesto* and *Fanpage* are trying to shift the focus back to the "militarization" of the city and the legitimacy of the social center's existence. However, the optics of the violence have forced the center-left into a defensive crouch, with the Democratic Party struggling to distance itself from the violence without breaking its alliance with the hard left. The takeaway is clear: the government will use the blood on the Turin pavement to fast-track the new Security Decree, framing any opposition to it as complicity with criminals.

Moving from political violence to the breakdown of security in the economic capital.

Milan is reeling from a violent Sunday in the Rogoredo district, an area infamous for its open-air drug market. As reported by *La Repubblica*, a man disarmed a security guard, beating him with a stick, and then engaged in a shootout with police before being neutralized. While *Il Fatto Quotidiano* focuses on the dynamics of the shooting and the critical condition of the aggressor, the Right is using this to paint a picture of a city out of control.

*Il Giornale* employs biting sarcasm, calling the drug dealing and violence the "Olympic Games of Rogoredo," a dark jab at Mayor Beppe Sala’s preparation for the 2026 Winter Games. *La Verità* links this directly to immigration policy, emphasizing the irregularity of the attacker to argue that the state has lost control of its territory. This story matters because it reinforces the "Law and Order" narrative that is currently the government's strongest political asset, putting the milanese administration under immense pressure just as the Olympic spotlight begins to turn toward the city.

Meanwhile, a quiet but significant tremor is being felt in the halls of Parliament regarding immigration.

While the politicians argue, the public—or at least a very mobilized segment of it—is taking action. *La Verità* triumphantly reports that a petition for a law on "Remigration"—essentially a proposal to enable mass expulsions and incentivize the return of immigrants to their home countries—has gathered over 60,000 signatures in just 24 hours. *Libero* frames this as a direct reaction to the "censorship" attempts by the Left, who tried to block the press conference announcing the initiative.

This is a high-consequence signal. *Il Manifesto* views this with alarm, describing it as a "race to the right" that normalizes extremist ideas. The success of this petition serves as a warning shot to the Meloni government from its own right flank: there is a base that feels the current hardened stance on migration is still not hard enough. It creates a new pole of pressure that could force the coalition to adopt even more radical positions to avoid being outflanked by grassroots populism.

But before we go, we return to the divine comedy playing out in a Roman basilica.

The case of the "Meloni Angel" continues to amuse and annoy the capital. The fresco in the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Lucina, which allegedly bears the face of the Prime Minister, has now triggered a formal request for an inquiry by the Democratic Party, who want to know if the restoration was politically tampered with. *Il Giornale* mocks the "visions" of the Left, quoting the church rector who insists the figures are merely "souls in Purgatory." Whether it is a miraculous apparition or a painter's sycophantic tribute, it serves as a perfect metaphor for modern Italy: a country where politics is so pervasive it literally stares down at you from the ceiling of the church.

I will see you tomorrow.

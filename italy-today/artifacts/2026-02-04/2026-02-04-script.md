Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", today is Wednesday 04 and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

We begin with the blitz. In Budapest, the gavel has come down heavy on Maja T., the German activist tried in the same neo-Nazi clash case involving Ilaria Salis; she has been sentenced to eight years in prison, a verdict *La Repubblica* calls a political warning shot from Orbán's Hungary to the European Left. Back in Rome, Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani has confirmed that Russian hackers have launched cyberattacks targeting both Italian embassies and the digital infrastructure of the Milano-Cortina Olympics, a digital front opening up just days before the torch arrives. Speaking of the Games, it is a bad day for Italy’s soft power: CONI President Giovanni Malagò failed to get elected to the International Olympic Committee’s executive board, defeated in a runoff by a Chilean candidate, a result *Il Fatto Quotidiano* describes as a "burning humiliation" for the Italian establishment. Meanwhile, the controversy over armed US agents on Italian soil for the Olympics seems to be deflating; Minister Piantedosi assured Parliament that the agents will have no operational powers, a statement intended to calm the sovereignist jitter within his own ranks. Finally, tragedy in the Alps, where an avalanche in Tarvisio has claimed a life, a grim reminder from nature amidst the political storms.

But the story dominating the front pages is the consummation of the divorce between the Captain and the General.

Roberto Vannacci, the vote-magnet of the last European elections, has turned his guns directly on Matteo Salvini. The rupture is total. In his first public appearance since leaving the League, reported gleefully by *La Repubblica* and *La Stampa*, Vannacci reversed the narrative of betrayal. He accuses Salvini of being the *real* traitor to the Right, citing the League’s "prone position" on sending arms to Ukraine and its failure to abolish the Fornero pension law. Vannacci claims his new movement, "Futuro Nazionale," is already polling at over 4 percent—a figure that, if accurate, comes almost entirely out of the League’s hide.

The reaction from the pro-government press is a mix of fury and damage control. *Il Giornale* and *Libero* represent the establishment’s shield wall, painting Vannacci as an "ingrate" who used the party as a taxi to Brussels and is now revealing his true, chaotic nature. *Il Giornale* runs quote after quote from League loyalists declaring the "chapter closed," trying to exorcise the General as a mere nuisance. However, the analysis from *Il Messaggero* suggests a deeper panic: if Vannacci’s 4 percent prevents the Center-Right coalition from securing crucial victories in upcoming regional elections, the "ingrate" might just become the kingmaker—or the executioner—of the current majority’s stability.

Meanwhile, the shockwaves from the Turin riots are colliding with constitutional hurdles at the Quirinale.

Following the violent clashes at the Askatasuna social center, Interior Minister Piantedosi briefed the Senate, rejecting accusations of police provocation and calling the events "urban warfare." While *Il Giornale* headlines with "The Left winks at terrorists," the real political machinery is grinding to a halt behind closed doors. *La Verità* and *Libero* report that the much-vaunted "Security Decree"—which includes harsh preventive detention measures and a crackdown on street blockades—has hit a wall. That wall is President Sergio Mattarella.

According to government sources, the Quirinale has expressed serious doubts about the constitutionality of banning citizens from specific areas without a trial and creating "separate jurisprudence" for protesters. *La Repubblica* notes the irony: while Salvini demands "prison for the violent," the judges in Turin actually released two of the arrested protesters and placed only one under house arrest, citing a lack of flight risk. The government is now trapped between its "Law and Order" base and the constitutional guardrails of the Republic, with the Security Decree likely returning to the drawing board for a softening that will infuriate the hardliners.

Turning to a quiet revolution that will affect millions of workers, the government is about to break one of the country's oldest taboos: salary secrecy.

Buried away from the screaming political headlines, *Il Corriere della Sera* details a new legislative decree landing on the Council of Ministers' table tomorrow. Transposing an EU directive, the new law will give Italian employees the right to request—and receive—written information on the average salary levels of colleagues doing the same work, broken down by gender. It bans "secrecy clauses" in contracts that prevent workers from discussing their pay.

For the business establishment, usually represented by *Il Sole 24 Ore*, this is a massive compliance headache requiring new transparency regarding "gender pay gaps." But for the unions and the Left, as echoed in *Fanpage*, this is a potential game-changer in a country where wage stagnation is chronic and pay disparity is often hidden behind a veil of "privacy." In a country where asking "how much do you make?" is considered ruder than asking about someone's sex life, the workplace dynamics are about to get very interesting.

But before we go, we return to the Roman church of San Lorenzo in Lucina for the final act of the "Meloni Angel."

After days of viral photos showing a newly restored cherub with the unmistakable face of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the Vatican has stepped in with the eraser. As *L’Unità* reports with evident amusement, the Vicariate ordered the face to be removed, citing "non-conformity with sacred iconography." The restorer, perhaps realizing his prank had gone too far—or not far enough—complied, painting over the Prime Minister’s likeness. It leaves us with a blank space on a fresco, perhaps the only place in Rome right now where Giorgia Meloni’s influence has been successfully curbed.

I will see you tomorrow.

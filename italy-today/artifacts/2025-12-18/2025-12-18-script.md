**ITALY TODAY**

Welcome, I am your host Amelia. Today is Thursday, December 18. Today's episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

**SECTION 1: THE LEAD**

In Turin, the thirty-year experiment of "illegal but tolerated" is officially over. At dawn this morning, police forces initiated the eviction of Askatasuna, the city’s most notorious social center, a stronghold of the antagonism that has defined Turin’s radical left since the 1990s. The operation quickly turned the streets into a battlefield. *Corriere della Sera* reports a chaotic scene of firecrackers and stones launched by activists, met instantly by police water cannons.

The reaction from the press tells you exactly where the fault lines lie. *La Stampa*—the historic voice of Turin’s industrial establishment, whose offices were actually targeted by these same groups earlier this year—frames the eviction as a necessary restoration of order and a "defense of democracy" endorsed by the center-left Mayor Stefano Lo Russo. Conversely, the right-wing *Libero Quotidiano* and *Il Giornale* are practically cheering, describing the subsequent protests not as activism but as "guerrilla warfare" and citing the eviction as proof that the government is finally dismantling the "zones of impunity" tolerated by previous administrations. Meanwhile, *Fanpage* focuses on the ground level, reporting on the anger of students and the aggressive police tactics, including a disturbing report of a 15-year-old allegedly forced to strip during a street search. For three decades, Askatasuna was a political headache; today, it is a police record.

**SECTION 2: THE ROUNDUP**

**Following up on yesterday’s report regarding the pension battle:** the government has blinked. Yesterday, we told you about the fierce coalition infighting over a proposal to hike the costs for university graduates buying back their study years for pension credits—the famous *riscatto della laurea*. Today, *Il Sole 24 Ore* confirms the retreat: Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti has reformulated the amendment. The proposed tightening will no longer be retroactive, meaning "acquired rights" are safe, and the cost increase is effectively off the table for now. It was a classic Roman trial balloon: floated in the committee, popped by public outcry, and now quietly swept away to keep the coalition peace.

**Meanwhile, buried deep within that same budget law,** a far quieter but potentially more significant change is taking shape. *La Repubblica* sounds the alarm on what it calls a government "blitz" to deregulate the arms industry. A new amendment reportedly simplifies the authorization process for the production and export of weaponry, removing certain checks and balances. While the opposition frames this as a dangerous shift toward a war economy, *Il Sole 24 Ore* analyzes it through a purely industrial lens, noting that the move is designed to align Italian defense manufacturing with the surging European demand for armaments. In Italy, even the business of war is ultimately a debate about bureaucracy.

**SECTION 3: THE WRAP-UP**

But before we go, here are a few other stories making the rounds.

First, the European Central Bank has decided to keep interest rates steady at 2%. *Corriere della Sera* notes that while inflation is under control, the bank is still cautious about declaring 'mission accomplished.'

Also, the Ministry of Tourism is back in the spotlight. After the digital "Open to Meraviglia" influencer campaign was mocked for using AI, Minister Daniela Santanchè has launched a "flesh and bone" Venus to represent Italy. *Il Fatto Quotidiano* is naturally merciless, mocking the casting call for a "sexy" tourist icon.

And finally, the investigation into "hiring friends and family" for the Milan-Cortina Olympics seems to be winding down. Prosecutors have asked to archive the case involving the son of Senate President Ignazio La Russa, proving once again that in Italy, nepotism is often considered bad taste, but rarely a crime.

That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.

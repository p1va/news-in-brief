**ITALY TODAY**

Welcome, I am your host Amelia. Today is Wednesday 17. Today's episode was curated by DeepSeek v3.2 Speciale.

**SECTION 1: THE LEAD**

Italy's highest court has delivered the final word in the legal saga of Matteo Salvini and the Open Arms migrant rescue ship. The Cassazione definitively acquitted the former interior minister, confirming earlier rulings that he did not commit kidnapping or abuse of office when he blocked the vessel from docking in 2019. Salvini, now deputy prime minister, declared: "Defending borders is not a crime." Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni immediately seized the moment, calling for applause in the Senate and hailing the verdict as a victory for the rule of law. As often in Italy, the news divided the press along familiar lines: *Il Giornale* celebrated the end of what it called "the great Open Arms hoax," while *La Repubblica* focused on the political theatre, noting Meloni's demand for applause. The left-leaning *Fanpage* and *Il Fatto Quotidiano* warned that the ruling could embolden anti-immigrant policies, but with the Supreme Court’s decision, this six‑year legal battle is now closed.

**SECTION 2: THE ROUNDUP**

*Pension reform sparks coalition clash*

While the courtroom drama ends, a fierce battle is brewing over pensions. The government's budget law includes a double tightening: raising the retirement age and slashing the value of buying back contribution years for university graduates – the so‑called *riscatto della laurea*. *Il Sole 24 Ore*, the authoritative business daily, outlines the technical measures, which aim to contain Italy's ballooning pension costs. But the Lega, a junior partner in the coalition, has tabled an amendment to scrap the entire pension package, calling it unfair. Under pressure, Prime Minister Meloni has already admitted that the graduate‑year rule was poorly drafted and promised to correct it so that it applies only to future contributions. The left, meanwhile, condemns the reforms as an attack on workers, with *La Repubblica* quoting union leaders threatening protests. The coming days will test the unity of the governing majority.

*Ukraine: no troops from Italy, and a gloomy forecast*

Turning to foreign affairs, Prime Minister Meloni used a speech in Parliament to rule out any Italian military deployment to Ukraine. "We will not send soldiers," she stated, adding that Moscow's demands remain "unreasonable." Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky struck a pessimistic note, telling *La Repubblica* that "signals from Moscow are clear – 2026 will be a year of war." In London, new Prime Minister Keir Starmer has issued an ultimatum to Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich: donate the 2.5 billion euros from the sale of Chelsea Football Club to Ukraine, or face legal action. The move is part of Western efforts to use frozen Russian assets for reconstruction. On the other side, Vladimir Putin insulted European leaders, calling them "pigs" and "profiteers," and vowed to win on the battlefield. As peace talks continue behind the scenes, the public rhetoric suggests the conflict is far from over.

**SECTION 3: THE WRAP-UP**

But before we go, here are a few other stories making headlines. First, Italy's spread – the gap between Italian and German 10‑year bond yields – has fallen to 66 basis points, its lowest level since 2009, signaling strong investor confidence. Second, the government has unveiled a major reform of condominium rules: administrators will need a university degree, cash payments are banned, and all owners can be held liable for unpaid fees. And finally, in the ongoing saga of the "family in the woods," social services reported that the children are afraid of showers and struggle with hygiene, while the family's lawyer insists they can read and write, contradicting earlier claims.

[energetic] Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", I am your host Amelia, Today is Tuesday 13 and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

[newscaster] Following up on yesterday’s breaking news, the diplomatic saga of Alberto Trentini and Mario Burlò has culminated on the tarmac of Rome’s Ciampino airport. The two men, freed from Venezuelan detention, touched down this morning to an emotional reception by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani. **Corriere Della Sera** captures the human moment, quoting Meloni asking Trentini, "Did you hug your mom? She was so worried," while **La Stampa** reports on the darker side of their ordeal, with Burlò recounting psychological torture and guards who called themselves "Hitler."

[cynical] But in Italy, even a joyous homecoming is immediate ammunition for political trench warfare. **Libero** and **Il Giornale** are on the offensive, framing the release as a triumph of the Right’s quiet diplomacy, while ferociously attacking the trade union CGIL and the Left for what they call a "deafening silence" and an inability to credit the government. On the other side of the aisle, **L'Unità** and **La Repubblica** are keen to remind readers that this liberation was likely a byproduct of the American "Absolute Resolve" operation that toppled Maduro, rather than Rome's influence alone, with **L'Unità** explicitly stating the government is taking credit for Washington's work.

[somber] Shifting our gaze from South America back to the Middle East, the rhetoric regarding Iran is shifting from diplomatic concern to open threats of war. **Corriere Della Sera** reports that Donald Trump has sent a direct message to the Iranian people: "Keep protesting, help is on the way," while claiming thousands have already died in the crackdown. **La Repubblica** adds a chilling detail, citing opposition sources that fear the death toll could actually be near 12,000.

[cynical] Domestically, this has cornered the Democratic Party. **Il Giornale** runs a scathing piece asking where Elly Schlein is, accusing the opposition leader—who was so vocal about women's rights previously—of vanishing now that the protests are against an anti-Western regime. Even **La Stampa**, usually more moderate, notes the "embarrassment" of the Left as former minister Piero Fassino openly criticizes his own party's hesitation to support the revolt, leaving the Right to claim the moral high ground on human rights in Tehran.

[newscaster] Bringing it back to Italian streets, the country was paralyzed today by a massive taxi strike that turned Rome’s city center into a zone of high tension. The drivers are protesting against algorithms and multinationals like Uber, demanding protection for their licenses. **Il Sole 24 Ore** reports high adherence to the strike, but the scene outside parliament turned ugly.

[cynical] **Fanpage** and **La Repubblica** document a physical altercation where Matteo Hallissey, a politician from the libera-market party +Europa, was kicked and spat on by protesters for provocatively bringing a credit card machine—a "POS"—to the rally, symbolizing the sector's infamous reluctance to accept card payments. While **AGI** reports that Transport Minister Matteo Salvini has summoned the unions for a meeting tomorrow, declaring he didn't want to "interfere," the consumer advocates are furious, calling the taxi lobby a "caste" holding the country hostage.

[energetic] But before we go, here is a quick scan of the rest of the newsstand.

[somber] First, a truly horrific story from Ferrara dominates the social pages. **Corriere Della Sera** and **Fanpage** report that a 14-year-old girl was found running barefoot in the street after escaping a 25-year-old man; investigations reveal she had been "sold" into marriage by her own mother for money.

[newscaster] Also, an update on the Crans-Montana tragedy. **La Stampa** confirms that the autopsy of 16-year-old Riccardo Minghetti points to asphyxia as the cause of death, while the Swiss courts have decided not to place the club owner, Jessica Moretti, under house arrest, though she is barred from leaving the country.

[energetic] And finally, a box office record. **Il Fatto Quotidiano** and **Corriere** confirm that comedian Checco Zalone has beaten himself; his latest film "Buen Camino" is now the highest-grossing Italian film in history, overtaking his previous records and now aiming to topple "Avatar" for the all-time top spot.

[newscaster] That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.

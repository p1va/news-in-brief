[energetic] Welcome to another episode of "Italy Today", I am your host Amelia, Today is Wednesday, January 07, and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.

[pause]

[newscaster] We begin in Rome, where the calendar has once again dragged the country back into the dark iconography of the 1970s. It is January 7th, the anniversary of the Acca Larentia killings, and as **ANSA** reports, hundreds of black-clad militants gathered this evening to perform the "Roman salute"—the fascist arm gesture—under the watch of police. While this ritual happens every year, the political optics have shifted dramatically in the last twenty-four hours.

[cynical] Usually, the headline is the Opposition outrage at the salutes. But today, the Government and its media allies have successfully flipped the script. **Il Giornale** and **Libero** are not leading with the fascist salutes, but with an "ambush" that occurred earlier in the day, where four youth activists from Meloni’s "Gioventù Nazionale" were allegedly attacked by left-wing antagonists. **Libero** screams of "Squadrist violence against the Right," allowing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni to issue a statement condemning political violence without having to directly address the embarrassing visuals of her base performing illegal salutes. Meanwhile, **Fanpage** captures the surreal defense coming from the Brothers of Italy party, highlighting a quote from MP Federico Mollicone who claimed today that "The Celtic cross is not a fascist symbol, but a religious one," a statement calling the critics "illiterate." **La Repubblica** remains focused on the salutes themselves, demanding to know why the police sanctioned a rally that **La Stampa** describes as "an open challenge to the constitution."

[somber] While Rome fights over symbols, Milan and Bologna are burying their children. Thousands gathered today for the funerals of the five young Italians killed in the Crans-Montana nightclub fire. **Corriere Della Sera** paints a heartbreaking scene at the packed churches in Milan for Achille and Chiara, where friends wept for lives cut short. But beneath the grief, a cold anger is forming against Switzerland. **Il Sole Ventiquattro Ore** notes that the families are demanding the truth, specifically regarding why the bodies showed no signs of burns—suggesting death by asphyxiation in a venue with locked exits. **La Stampa** reports that the Swiss authorities are being accused of "excessive haste" to close the case, with some families fearing a cover-up to protect the local tourism industry. As one father told **La Repubblica**, "We sent them to a place we thought was safe, and they returned in caskets due to greed."

[newscaster] Following up on yesterday’s report regarding the murder of the train conductor in Bologna, the manhunt has produced a suspect, and with it, a furious political storm regarding national security. The alleged killer, identified as Marin Jelenic, was captured today. **La Verità** and **Libero** are absolutely savage this evening, revealing that the suspect is a Croatian national who already had an active expulsion order that was never enforced. **Il Giornale** frames this as the ultimate failure of the "do-gooder" Leftist judiciary, arguing that a man known to be dangerous was left free to roam the railways. **Il Fatto Quotidiano**, usually quick to defend the judiciary, is forced to admit the "abysmal failure" of the system, noting that Jelenic had even been stopped for shoplifting *hours* before the murder but was let go. The railway unions have confirmed the strike remains in effect, but the narrative has shifted from "worker safety" to "failed deportation."

[pause]

[energetic] But before we go, here is a quick scan of the rest of the newsstand.

[newscaster] First, while European leaders nervously laugh it off, **La Repubblica** reports that the White House is "actively discussing" the purchase of Greenland. While **Il Post** explains the strategic mineral value of the island, **Adnkronos** notes the geopolitical reality: Trump is reportedly looking to bypass Denmark entirely to make a deal directly with the local government, a move that **Il Messaggero** calls a direct challenge to EU sovereignty.

[quick pause]

[cynical] Also, your grocery bill is about to get worse. **Il Sole Ventiquattro Ore** reports that inflation in Italy has ticked back up to 1.2% in December, driven almost entirely by a spike in food prices and transport costs. The brief respite seems to be over, and **La Stampa** warns that the "shopping cart" inflation is hitting the most vulnerable families just as the holiday bills come due.

[quick pause]

[energetic] And finally, some good news for a lucky few. **ANSA** reports that the "Lotteria Italia"—the national epiphany lottery—has drawn its winners. The massive five-million-euro jackpot was sold in Rome, further cementing the capital's lucky streak this week, though **Fanpage** wryly notes that with the current inflation rate, that five million might just cover the rent.

[newscaster] That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.

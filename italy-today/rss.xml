      <description>**THE ROMAN OBSERVER**
Buongiorno, I am Amelia. It is Monday 15, and here is the view from Rome. Today's briefing was curated by DeepSeek-V3.2-Special.
**PART 1: THE HEADLINES (The &quot;Terza Pagina&quot;)**
1. **The Imam's Release: Government vs Judiciary**  
   - **The Fact:** A Turin court ordered the release of Tunisian imam Mohamed Shahin from a detention center, ruling his continued detention unlawful.  
   - **The Spin:** While left-leaning La Repubblica reported the decision with a focus on the legal reasoning, right-wing Il Giornale echoed Premier Meloni's outrage, accusing the judiciary of undermining national security.  
   - **The Takeaway:** The case underscores the escalating conflict between the executive and the judiciary over immigration policy, with both sides digging in.
2. **Budget Ballooning: 3.5 Billion for Businesses, Bridge Funds Delayed**  
   - **The Fact:** The government unveiled a last-minute package of €3.5 billion in the budget law, earmarked for business support, while postponing funding for the controversial Messina Bridge project.  
   - **The Spin:** Opposition parties and left-wing media slammed the move as proof of disarray, while Economy Minister Giorgetti argued it was necessary to boost a faltering economy.  
   - **The Takeaway:** The extra spending risks widening the deficit, but the real story is the quiet shelving of a flagship infrastructure promise.
3. **John Elkann Forced to Stand Trial Over Agnelli Inheritance**  
   - **The Fact:** A Milan judge ordered the forced indictment of Fiat chairman John Elkann on fraud charges related to the inheritance of Marella Caracciolo, widow of Gianni Agnelli.  
   - **The Spin:** Center-left outlets portrayed the decision as justice catching up with the elite; right-leaning commentators called it judicial overreach and pointed to Elkann's defense labeling the ruling &quot;abnormal.&quot;  
   - **The Takeaway:** The trial will shine an uncomfortable spotlight on Italy's most powerful industrial dynasty and could have ripple effects across the corporate landscape.
**PART 2: IL CAFFÈ (Rapid Fire)**  
- **Cannabis Sector Wins:** The Council of State ruled that companies can sell CBD oil, ending a two-year legal battle and giving a boost to Italy's hemp industry.  
- **IMF’s Mixed Report:** The IMF praised Italy's fiscal discipline but warned the government to &quot;keep pedaling&quot; to sustain growth and reduce public debt.  
- **Poll Shift:** A new poll shows a dip for Fratelli d'Italia and a rise for the Democratic Party, narrowing the gap.  
- **Ukraine Summit:** At the Berlin meeting, European leaders backed a multinational force for Ukraine and urged President Zelensky to consult his people on peace terms; Meloni said she expects &quot;progress.&quot;</description>

      <description>**ITALY TODAY**
Welcome, I am your host Amelia. Today is Tuesday 16. Today's episode was curated by DeepSeek v3.2 Speciale.
The world is closer than ever to a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine – but the final stretch is proving to be a diplomatic minefield. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani declared today that the agreement is “90 percent complete,” thanks in large part to Donald Trump’s shuttle diplomacy. Yet within hours, Moscow laid down its red lines: no NATO troops on Ukrainian soil, and no concessions on the territories it has seized – meaning Donbass and the southern regions remain firmly in Russian hands. President Zelensky, for his part, insists that Ukraine will never recognize the Donbass as Russian. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, Europe’s big three – Italy, France, and Germany – are caught in a classic Catch‑22, each waiting for the other to shoulder the political burden of pressuring Kyiv into accepting painful compromises. The left‑wing press warns that caving to Putin would reward aggression, while the right celebrates a historic chance to stop the bloodshed. For now, the champagne remains on ice.
While diplomats wrangle over Ukraine, back in Brussels, the European Commission is preparing a major U‑turn on another front: the future of the internal combustion engine. After years of insisting that all new cars sold from 2035 must be zero‑emission, Brussels is now expected to propose a revision that would allow combustion engines to stay on the road – as long as they run on synthetic fuels or other low‑carbon technologies. The move comes after intense lobbying from Germany and Italy, home to Europe’s largest carmakers, who argued that an outright ban would cost jobs and ignore technological alternatives. Environmental groups are outraged, with left‑leaning papers like *La Repubblica* calling it a betrayal of the EU’s green transition. On the right, *Il Giornale* celebrates a return to sanity after what it calls “years of ideological diktats.”
Meanwhile, here at home, the Italian government is opening the spending taps for defense. Prime Minister Meloni’s cabinet has signed off on four urgent decrees that unlock 3.5 billion euros for the armed forces, with the money earmarked for drones, ships, and submarines. The move signals Rome’s commitment to bolstering its military capabilities at a time when Europe is rearming in the shadow of the Ukraine war and rising tensions in the Mediterranean. The left is already questioning the priorities – arguing that the funds would be better spent on healthcare or education – while the right counters that a strong defense is non‑negotiable in an increasingly dangerous world.
But before we go, here are a few other stories that caught our eye today. First, Italy’s inflation rate dropped to 1.1% in November, the lowest since January, thanks largely to falling energy prices – a rare bit of good news for households. Second, Rome’s city hall is set to introduce a 2‑euro ticket to visit the Trevi Fountain starting January 7th. The move could bring in an estimated 20 million euros per year, though critics call it a toll on culture. And finally, Australian police are investigating a trip the Sydney attackers made to the Philippines, suggesting international jihadist links. The death toll stands at 12, with many more wounded.</description>

      <description>**ITALY TODAY**
Welcome, I am your host Amelia. Today is Wednesday 17. Today's episode was curated by DeepSeek v3.2 Speciale.
**SECTION 1: THE LEAD**
Italy's highest court has delivered the final word in the legal saga of Matteo Salvini and the Open Arms migrant rescue ship. The Cassazione definitively acquitted the former interior minister, confirming earlier rulings that he did not commit kidnapping or abuse of office when he blocked the vessel from docking in 2019. Salvini, now deputy prime minister, declared: &quot;Defending borders is not a crime.&quot; Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni immediately seized the moment, calling for applause in the Senate and hailing the verdict as a victory for the rule of law. As often in Italy, the news divided the press along familiar lines: *Il Giornale* celebrated the end of what it called &quot;the great Open Arms hoax,&quot; while *La Repubblica* focused on the political theatre, noting Meloni's demand for applause. The left-leaning *Fanpage* and *Il Fatto Quotidiano* warned that the ruling could embolden anti-immigrant policies, but with the Supreme Court’s decision, this six‑year legal battle is now closed.
**SECTION 2: THE ROUNDUP**
*Pension reform sparks coalition clash*
While the courtroom drama ends, a fierce battle is brewing over pensions. The government's budget law includes a double tightening: raising the retirement age and slashing the value of buying back contribution years for university graduates – the so‑called *riscatto della laurea*. *Il Sole 24 Ore*, the authoritative business daily, outlines the technical measures, which aim to contain Italy's ballooning pension costs. But the Lega, a junior partner in the coalition, has tabled an amendment to scrap the entire pension package, calling it unfair. Under pressure, Prime Minister Meloni has already admitted that the graduate‑year rule was poorly drafted and promised to correct it so that it applies only to future contributions. The left, meanwhile, condemns the reforms as an attack on workers, with *La Repubblica* quoting union leaders threatening protests. The coming days will test the unity of the governing majority.
*Ukraine: no troops from Italy, and a gloomy forecast*
Turning to foreign affairs, Prime Minister Meloni used a speech in Parliament to rule out any Italian military deployment to Ukraine. &quot;We will not send soldiers,&quot; she stated, adding that Moscow's demands remain &quot;unreasonable.&quot; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky struck a pessimistic note, telling *La Repubblica* that &quot;signals from Moscow are clear – 2026 will be a year of war.&quot; In London, new Prime Minister Keir Starmer has issued an ultimatum to Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich: donate the 2.5 billion euros from the sale of Chelsea Football Club to Ukraine, or face legal action. The move is part of Western efforts to use frozen Russian assets for reconstruction. On the other side, Vladimir Putin insulted European leaders, calling them &quot;pigs&quot; and &quot;profiteers,&quot; and vowed to win on the battlefield. As peace talks continue behind the scenes, the public rhetoric suggests the conflict is far from over.
**SECTION 3: THE WRAP-UP**
But before we go, here are a few other stories making headlines. First, Italy's spread – the gap between Italian and German 10‑year bond yields – has fallen to 66 basis points, its lowest level since 2009, signaling strong investor confidence. Second, the government has unveiled a major reform of condominium rules: administrators will need a university degree, cash payments are banned, and all owners can be held liable for unpaid fees. And finally, in the ongoing saga of the &quot;family in the woods,&quot; social services reported that the children are afraid of showers and struggle with hygiene, while the family's lawyer insists they can read and write, contradicting earlier claims.</description>

      <description>**ITALY TODAY**
Welcome, I am your host Amelia. Today is Thursday, December 18. Today's episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.
**SECTION 1: THE LEAD**
In Turin, the thirty-year experiment of &quot;illegal but tolerated&quot; is officially over. At dawn this morning, police forces initiated the eviction of Askatasuna, the city’s most notorious social center, a stronghold of the antagonism that has defined Turin’s radical left since the 1990s. The operation quickly turned the streets into a battlefield. *Corriere della Sera* reports a chaotic scene of firecrackers and stones launched by activists, met instantly by police water cannons.
The reaction from the press tells you exactly where the fault lines lie. *La Stampa*—the historic voice of Turin’s industrial establishment, whose offices were actually targeted by these same groups earlier this year—frames the eviction as a necessary restoration of order and a &quot;defense of democracy&quot; endorsed by the center-left Mayor Stefano Lo Russo. Conversely, the right-wing *Libero Quotidiano* and *Il Giornale* are practically cheering, describing the subsequent protests not as activism but as &quot;guerrilla warfare&quot; and citing the eviction as proof that the government is finally dismantling the &quot;zones of impunity&quot; tolerated by previous administrations. Meanwhile, *Fanpage* focuses on the ground level, reporting on the anger of students and the aggressive police tactics, including a disturbing report of a 15-year-old allegedly forced to strip during a street search. For three decades, Askatasuna was a political headache; today, it is a police record.
**SECTION 2: THE ROUNDUP**
**Following up on yesterday’s report regarding the pension battle:** the government has blinked. Yesterday, we told you about the fierce coalition infighting over a proposal to hike the costs for university graduates buying back their study years for pension credits—the famous *riscatto della laurea*. Today, *Il Sole 24 Ore* confirms the retreat: Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti has reformulated the amendment. The proposed tightening will no longer be retroactive, meaning &quot;acquired rights&quot; are safe, and the cost increase is effectively off the table for now. It was a classic Roman trial balloon: floated in the committee, popped by public outcry, and now quietly swept away to keep the coalition peace.
**Meanwhile, buried deep within that same budget law,** a far quieter but potentially more significant change is taking shape. *La Repubblica* sounds the alarm on what it calls a government &quot;blitz&quot; to deregulate the arms industry. A new amendment reportedly simplifies the authorization process for the production and export of weaponry, removing certain checks and balances. While the opposition frames this as a dangerous shift toward a war economy, *Il Sole 24 Ore* analyzes it through a purely industrial lens, noting that the move is designed to align Italian defense manufacturing with the surging European demand for armaments. In Italy, even the business of war is ultimately a debate about bureaucracy.
**SECTION 3: THE WRAP-UP**
But before we go, here are a few other stories making the rounds.
First, the European Central Bank has decided to keep interest rates steady at 2%. *Corriere della Sera* notes that while inflation is under control, the bank is still cautious about declaring 'mission accomplished.'
Also, the Ministry of Tourism is back in the spotlight. After the digital &quot;Open to Meraviglia&quot; influencer campaign was mocked for using AI, Minister Daniela Santanchè has launched a &quot;flesh and bone&quot; Venus to represent Italy. *Il Fatto Quotidiano* is naturally merciless, mocking the casting call for a &quot;sexy&quot; tourist icon.
And finally, the investigation into &quot;hiring friends and family&quot; for the Milan-Cortina Olympics seems to be winding down. Prosecutors have asked to archive the case involving the son of Senate President Ignazio La Russa, proving once again that in Italy, nepotism is often considered bad taste, but rarely a crime.
That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.</description>

      <description>**ITALY TODAY**
Welcome, I am your host Amelia. Today is Friday, December 19. Today's episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.
**SECTION 1: THE LEAD**
Following up on yesterday's report, the cracks in the government coalition we mentioned have turned into a landslide. If yesterday was about a tactical retreat on university pension buybacks, today is about a strategic surrender on the entire pension front. During a chaotic night in the Budget Committee, the government majority effectively deleted its own proposals to reform the pension system for 2026.
According to *Il Sole 24 Ore*—the sober voice of the business community—a full-blown government crisis was &quot;avoided by a whisper.&quot; To keep the peace between the League and Forza Italia, the executive scrapped the controversial changes to the &quot;TFR&quot; severance pay and the tightening of early retirement rules. Effectively, the government has chosen stability over reform, opting to leave things exactly as they are rather than risk a vote that could shatter the alliance.
The reaction this morning is a perfect study in Italian media spin. *La Repubblica* and the Democratic Party are claiming victory, with opposition leader Elly Schlein declaring that &quot;the majority is broken&quot; and arguing that the government is paralyzed by infighting. Conversely, the right-wing papers are looking elsewhere. *Libero Quotidiano* and *Il Giornale* completely ignore the pension failure, focusing instead on the one victory the coalition managed to secure: a new 1,500 euro &quot;voucher&quot; for families sending children to private, parochial schools. For the Right, this is a triumph for educational freedom; for the rest of the country, it looks like a consolation prize in a budget law that has largely decided to do nothing at all.
**SECTION 2: THE ROUNDUP**
Moving from the paralysis in Parliament to the cold case that never sleeps...
There has been a significant, albeit mysterious, development in the disappearance of Emanuela Orlandi—the Vatican citizen who vanished into thin air 42 years ago. *Corriere della Sera* and *Adnkronos* report that the Rome Prosecutor’s office has formally placed a new person under investigation. While the suspect’s name remains shielded, the charge is &quot;false information to a public prosecutor.&quot; This suggests investigators believe someone is still lying to protect the secrets of 1983. While *La Stampa* highlights this as a &quot;colpo di scena&quot;—a plot twist—veteran observers remain skeptical. In Italy, new investigations into Orlandi usually signal the beginning of a new mystery, rather than the end of the old one.
Meanwhile, prepare your wallets if you are planning a trip to the capital. After months of speculation, it is official: looking at the Trevi Fountain will complicate your logistics, and eventually, your bank account. *AGI* and *Il Post* report that starting February 1st, access to the fountain’s lower basin will be restricted and ticketed at two euros. Mayor Roberto Gualtieri argues this is about crowd control rather than revenue, a view supported by *Il Messaggero’s* local reporting. However, critics fear this is the turning point where Rome ceases to be a city and officially becomes a theme park.
**SECTION 3: THE WRAP-UP**
But before we go, here are a few other stories making the rounds:
First, a major shakeup in the Italian media landscape. *La Repubblica* reports that the Del Vecchio family—heirs to the Luxottica eyewear fortune—has acquired a 30% stake in *Il Giornale*. It is a fascinating move: a family historically aligned with liberal finance buying into the house organ of the institutional Right.
Also, Italian fashion continues its eastward migration. *Corriere della Sera* notes that the luxury sneaker brand &quot;Golden Goose&quot; has been sold to a consortium including funds from Hong Kong and Singapore for 2.5 billion euros.
And finally, tensions are spiking in the Mediterranean. *La Verità* and *Repubblica* both report that a Russian oil tanker was struck, allegedly by Ukraine, in waters surprisingly close to Sicily. The war, it seems, is no longer just in the Black Sea.
That is the state of the country today. I will see you on Monday.</description>

      <description>**ITALY TODAY**
Welcome, I am your host Amelia. Today is Saturday, December 20. Today’s episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.
**SECTION 1: THE LEAD**
If yesterday the tension in Italy was confined to the hush of parliamentary committee rooms, today it spilled violently into the streets. The lead story across the entire peninsula involves water cannons, tear gas, and burning dumpsters in the elegant center of Turin.
The flashpoint is &quot;Askatasuna,&quot; a historic social center—essentially a squatted building occupied by left-wing collectives—which has become a proxy war for national politics. An unauthorized march against the center's eviction turned into urban warfare, with *Corriere della Sera* and *ANSA* confirming at least seven police officers injured and repeated charges by riot squads.
The media coverage depends entirely on which side of the barricade the editors are standing on. For the Right, this is a vindication of their &quot;law and order&quot; platform. *Libero Quotidiano* and *Il Giornale* are ferocious, framing the protesters not as activists but as &quot;violent daddy’s boys&quot; playing at revolution. They are squarely blaming the Democratic Party mayor of Turin, Stefano Lo Russo, for having previously attempted to negotiate a legalization of the space. Deputy Prime Minister Antonio Tajani and League leader Matteo Salvini are practically reading from the same script, demanding &quot;no more tolerance&quot; for what they call illegal fortresses of the extreme Left.
On the other side, *La Repubblica* and *La Stampa*—the latter effectively the hometown paper of the Turin establishment—paint a picture of a city under siege, but they focus heavily on the &quot;tension&quot; and the heavy-handed police response. *Il Fatto Quotidiano* goes further, highlighting the images of students being blasted by water cannons. The takeaway here is political: the government is using the smoke in Turin to accuse the opposition of being soft on crime, while the Left is accusing the government of turning the police force into a political cudgel.
**SECTION 2: THE ROUNDUP**
Moving from the squares back to the Senate, the chaos over the budget law continues, though the weapons there are amendments rather than cobblestones.
Following up on yesterday's report about the pension reform collapse, the government coalition spent Friday fighting over a tax amnesty. *Corriere della Sera* reports a sharp internecine battle over a proposed &quot;condono,&quot; or pardon, for past tax evasions. In a rare twist, Giorgia Meloni’s Brothers of Italy party had to frantically withdraw an amendment that would have reopened tax settlement deadlines, after realizing it was creating too much friction with their coalition partners and Brussels. *Il Sole 24 Ore*, looking past the political theater to the bottom line, notes that while the politicians fight, the taxman is quietly sharpening his knives for 2026: new levies on short-term rentals and e-commerce deliveries are basically locked in.
Meanwhile, the Italian state received a bill from the past that it truly cannot afford. In a ruling that *La Repubblica* calls a &quot;billion-euro sting,&quot; the Court of Cassation has ordered the government to repay the telecom giant TIM—formerly Telecom Italia—roughly one billion euros. This dates back to a regulatory fee collected in 1998 that the courts deemed illegitimate. *Il Sole 24 Ore* explains that this is a massive headache for the Ministry of Finance, which now has to find a billion euros in a budget that was already stripped to the bone just to afford 1500-euro vouchers for private schools.
**SECTION 3: THE WRAP-UP**
But before we go, here is a quick scan of the rest of the newsstand:
First, a classic case of Italian bureaucratic surrealism. *La Repubblica* notes that in the national entrance exam for Medical School, roughly 44,000 students managed to hand in their physics tests, sparking a debate on whether the test—or the students—were properly prepared.
Also, the &quot;Epstein Files&quot; released in the US are splashing across Italian front pages today. *Il Fatto Quotidiano* and *La Verità* are digging into the mentions of prominent figures, salaciously detailing the allegations involving Prince Andrew and Bill Clinton, providing plenty of fodder for the anti-establishment press.
And finally, if you are looking for snow this Christmas, you might be out of luck. *Adnkronos* reports that while the weather is turning unstable, a &quot;warm tongue&quot; of air is likely to turn the white Christmas into a wet one for most of the cities, leaving the ski resorts in the Alto Adige worrying about their artificial snow cannons.
That is the state of the country today. I will see you on Monday.</description>

      <description>**ITALY TODAY**
Welcome, I am your host Amelia. Today is Sunday, December 21. Today’s episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.
**SECTION 1: THE LEAD**
The front pages today are dominated by a clash over gender, identity, and the safety of women, splitting the country down a jagged ideological line.
The spark is a landmark ruling from a tribunal in La Spezia, which authorized a 13-year-old to legally change their gender identity. For the progressive press, particularly *La Repubblica* and *Fanpage*, this is a victory for civil rights and awareness, with *Fanpage* highlighting that the teenager had a &quot;consolidated&quot; identity despite their young age. However, the reaction from the Right is immediate and fierce. *La Verità* and *Il Giornale* frame this not as rights, but as a dangerous precipice, questioning the wisdom of allowing irreversible legal changes for a minor, with *Libero* amplifying fears of &quot;gender ideology&quot; taking root in the courts.
But this theoretical debate is happening against a backdrop of very physical violence. The news cycle is heavy with the report of yet another femicide in Cava de' Tirreni, near Salerno, where a man stabbed his partner to death before killing himself. While the mainstream agencies like *ANSA* report the grim facts, the political spin appears elsewhere. *Libero Quotidiano* and *Il Giornale* are aggressively highlighting a separate case in Cervia, where the Democratic Party mayor is under investigation for mistreating his wife. For the right-wing press, this is a distinct opportunity to attack the moral high ground of the Left, suggesting that the party which champions women's rights in public has a problem with them in private.
**SECTION 2: THE ROUNDUP**
Moving from the culture wars to the actual war, the economic cost of the conflict in Ukraine is becoming a wedge issue in the Italian press.
Following the stalemate in peace talks reported by *Corriere della Sera*—which notes that Moscow has frozen any idea of a trilateral summit—the right-wing press is looking at the receipt. *La Verità* leads with a provocative headline claiming that Ukrainian President Zelensky &quot;costs us 220 euros a head,&quot; a narrative designed to stoke resentment among taxpayers. This comes as *Il Sole 24 Ore* reports that the government, desperate to balance the books, is slashing the &quot;Development and Cohesion Fund,&quot; cutting resources for infrastructure in regions like Emilia-Romagna and Basilicata. The narrative is clear: the money for foreign wars is now visibly eating into domestic concrete.
Meanwhile, following up on yesterday's lead regarding the riots in Turin, the street battles have ended, but the blame game has just begun. The focus has shifted from the masked protesters to their high-profile defenders. *Libero* and *Il Giornale* are furious that popular cultural figures, including the cartoonist Zerocalcare, have expressed solidarity with the Askatasuna social center. The Right is framing this as the &quot;intellectual elite&quot; pampering violent extremists who injure police officers. *La Stampa*, the voice of the Turin establishment, takes a more somber tone, cleaning up the physical mess of the riots while noting that the political rift between the mayor and the central government is only widening.
**SECTION 3: THE WRAP-UP**
But before we go, here is a quick scan of the rest of the newsstand:
First, the &quot;Epstein Files&quot; continue to trickle out, and the Italian press is fascinated by the American censorship. *Il Fatto Quotidiano* and *Adnkronos* both highlight that while new pages were released, key photographs—including one allegedly showing Donald Trump—have mysteriously vanished from the official docket, fueling fresh conspiracy theories.
Also, a moment of national relief on the ski slopes. After a season of injuries and doubts, Italian skiing superstar Sofia Goggia won the Super-G in Val d’Isère today. *Corriere della Sera* reports she was in tears at the finish line, calling it a &quot;liberation.&quot;
And finally, winter has officially arrived, literally. *Il Post* marks the solstice, reminding us that today is the shortest day of the year. And right on cue, *La Stampa* warns that the unseasonably warm &quot;tongue&quot; of air we mentioned yesterday is about to be cut off by a cold snap, with snow finally predicted for the Northwest just in time for Christmas.
That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.</description>

      <description>**ITALY TODAY**
Welcome, I am your host Amelia. Today is Monday, December 22. Today’s episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.
**SECTION 1: THE LEAD**
We begin today with a rare and significant intervention from the Quirinale Palace that has temporarily silenced the usual partisan shouting match.
President Sergio Mattarella has signed five pardons—acts of clemency that cut straight through the rigid application of Italian law to address human tragedy. The most discussed case, highlighted with emotional weight by *Corriere della Sera*, is that of massive humanity shown to Franco Cioni, a man who killed his terminally ill wife to end her suffering. While the courts called it murder, Mattarella effectively called it mercy. But the President also waded into more political waters. He pardoned a Libyan footballer who had been jailed as a &quot;human trafficker&quot;—a *scafista*—simply for steering a migrant boat. While *La Repubblica* cheers this as the correction of a judicial error against a refugee, the silence from the hard Right—usually vocal about locking up smugglers—is deafening. Even *Il Giornale* reports the news straight, acknowledging the President’s prerogative without the usual polemics.
However, the truce ends when we turn to the media wars surrounding the government. The fallout from the Turin riots, which we covered yesterday, has mutated into a high-brow feud between the Culture Minister, Alessandro Giuli, and right-wing intellectuals. *Libero Quotidiano* and *Il Giornale* are aggressively defending Giuli against accusations of being too soft on the Left, while attacking journalists like Marcello Veneziani for criticizing the government from the Right. It is a complex, internecine battle within the conservative camp, proving that in Rome, the most dangerous fire often comes from inside your own tent.
**SECTION 2: THE ROUNDUP**
Moving from the presidential palace to the parliamentary trenches, the battle over the budget law—the *Manovra*—has turned nasty in its final hours.
As the Senate rushes to approve the bill before Christmas, a controversial amendment has sparked fury on the Left. *Il Fatto Quotidiano* is screaming about the so-called &quot;Norma Pogliese,&quot; a rule that limits the financial liability of public administrators and managers who waste public money, capping their repayments at 30% of the damage. *Il Fatto* frames this as &quot;wickedness against workers&quot; paired with a &quot;save-the-managers&quot; shield. *ANSA* confirms the tension in the chamber is palpable. Meanwhile, *Il Sole 24 Ore* plays the adult in the room, focusing less on the political squabbles and more on the structural reality: the &quot;maxi-amendment&quot; is being rammed through with a vote of confidence, a standard but ugly practice that effectively bypasses debate to keep the country’s accounts from collapsing by January 1st.
Turning to the digital economy, the Italian state has taken a lucrative bite out of Silicon Valley. The Antitrust authority has slapped Apple with a fine of nearly 99 million euros. *Il Sole 24 Ore* explains that this is about data privacy and app dominance—specifically, Apple using its privacy settings to disadvantage third-party app developers while favoring its own. While *Il Post* breaks down the technicalities of the abuse of dominant position, *Libero* takes a more cynical view, noting that these fines look increasingly like a secondary tax revenue stream for the state as it struggles to find cash elsewhere.
**SECTION 3: THE WRAP-UP**
But before we go, here is a quick scan of the rest of the newsstand:
First, the &quot;globalization&quot; of Italian soccer has hit a snag. *Corriere della Sera* reports a humiliating U-turn for the League: the Milan-Como match, originally scheduled to be played in Australia to wow international markets, has been cancelled and moved back to San Siro. Apparently, the logistics of flying teams to Perth for a mid-season game were exactly as impossible as they sounded.
Also, the gossip pages are eating the news pages today. *Fanpage* and *La Stampa* are following the surreal legal battle between paparazzi king Fabrizio Corona and TV host Alfonso Signorini. Corona is now under investigation for &quot;revenge porn&quot; after allegedly threatening to release private chats. It is a story of pure noise, but it is dominating the online conversation.
And finally, if you are planning to travel for Christmas, brace yourselves. *Il Fatto Quotidiano* and weather outlets are warning of a distinct shift: the warm spell is breaking, and snow is forecast even at low altitudes for the holidays. A &quot;White Christmas&quot; is coming, along with the inevitable traffic jams.
That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.</description>

      <description>**ITALY TODAY**
Welcome, I am your host Amelia. Today is Tuesday, December 23. Today's episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.
**SECTION 1: THE LEAD**
We begin with the money. Following up on yesterday's report about the frantic race to close the books, the Senate has officially approved the 2025 Budget Law.
The &quot;Manovra&quot;—a 22-billion-euro package—passed with 110 votes in favor and 66 against, effectively securing the government's economic roadmap just under the holiday wire. The narrative war is, predictable, split cleanly down the middle. Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti is taking a victory lap, quoted by *Il Sole 24 Ore* and *Adnkronos* as saying the government achieved &quot;things that seemed impossible,&quot; navigating tight fiscal constraints without triggering a market revolt. The establishment Right, represented by *Il Giornale*, frames this as a triumph of &quot;common sense&quot; and stability.
However, the view from the Opposition benches is far less festive. *La Repubblica* and *Il Fatto Quotidiano* describe the vote as a rubber-stamping of austerity, accusing Premier Meloni of a &quot;voltafaccia&quot;—a complete about-face—on her campaign promises regarding pension cuts and healthcare funding. *Il Fatto* is particularly aggressive, noting that while the government preaches prudence for workers, the controversial liability shield for public administrators—which we flagged yesterday—seems to have slipped through the noise. The bill now heads to the Chamber of Deputies for a final, formal ratification, but for all intents and purposes, the deal is done.
**SECTION 2: THE ROUNDUP**
Moving from the treasury to a symbolic cultural battle, the Quirinale has issued a directive that hits the Italian Right where it breathes: the National Anthem.
*Corriere della Sera* and *ANSA* report that the military has been ordered to stop shouting the word &quot;Sì!&quot; at the very end of the *Inno di Mameli*. For years, it has been a custom—popularized in stadiums and embraced by nationalist politicians—to scream &quot;Yes!&quot; after the line &quot;L'Italia chiamò.&quot; But strictly speaking, that word isn't in the score. The Presidency of the Republic has decided to restore the &quot;original solemnity&quot; of the piece. *Il Giornale* notes the irony with a smirk: practically moments after the news broke, Premier Meloni was filmed with the Alpini troops, enthusiastically shouting the now-banned &quot;Sì.&quot; It is a small detail, but in Italy, tell a politician to be silent, and they will instinctively shout louder.
Turning to the courts, a dark shadow has been cast over the Five Star Movement, albeit indirectly. The motivations for the sexual assault conviction of Ciro Grillo—son of the movement’s founder Beppe Grillo—have been released, and they are damning.
*La Repubblica* and *Il Giornale*—usually at odds—are reporting the same grim details from the judges: the assault on the young woman was characterized by &quot;particular brutality&quot; and the &quot;abuse of her fragility.&quot; The court explicitly rejected the defense's strategy of undermining the victim's credibility. While *Fanpage* focuses on the vindication of the victim after a grueling media trial, *Il Giornale* uses the &quot;brutality&quot; of the act to hammer the moral standing of the Grillo family. It is a judicial conclusion that leaves little room for political spin.
**SECTION 3: THE WRAP-UP**
But before we go, here is a final scan of the newsstand:
First, a political earthquake in the Emilia-Romagna region. *Il Giornale*, *La Repubblica*, and *Il Sole* all report that the PD Mayor of Cervia, Mattia Missiroli, has resigned after being placed under investigation for domestic abuse. It is a rapid fall from grace that has left the local Democratic Party reeling right before Christmas.
Also, the saga of Fabrizio Corona and TV host Alfonso Signorini continues to degrade. Following our report yesterday, Corona appeared in court today, threatening to unleash an &quot;Italian Me Too&quot; moment and claiming to have over 100 testimonies against the &quot;Signorini System.&quot; It is pure tabloid theater, but as *Fanpage* notes, it is dominating the social conversation.
And finally, a bizarre crime story out of Verona that has confused everyone. *Il Sole 24 Ore* reports that a 25-year-old man has been identified as the person who shot at a group of cyclists with an air rifle. His motive? He simply has a &quot;marked aversion&quot; to bicycles. In Italy, where the cyclist-motorist war is eternal, this is unfortunately the most relatable headline of the day.
That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.</description>

      <description>**ITALY TODAY**
Welcome, I am your host Amelia. Today is Wednesday, December 24—Christmas Eve. Today's episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.
**SECTION 1: THE LEAD**
We begin with a country split between a white Christmas, a wet Christmas, and a tragic one. While the festive lights are on, the operational reality of the peninsula is currently defined by a severe &quot;polar vortex.&quot;
*Il Sole 24 Ore* and *Corriere della Sera* report that the holiday exodus is facing a dual threat: gridlock and rising water. The A1 motorway—the country's spinal cord—saw eleven kilometers of queues today following a tanker explosion, while the rail network is suffering delays of over 90 minutes on the high-speed lines to Rome and Naples. But the real anxiety is in the north: The Civil Protection agency has issued a &quot;Red Alert&quot; for parts of Emilia-Romagna—specifically the Bologna area—where river levels are surging again. For a region still traumatized by last year’s floods, the holidays are beginning with sandbags rather than spumante.
Meanwhile, tragically, the Mediterranean does not take a holiday break. *La Repubblica* and the NGO Sea Watch report a massive shipwreck off the coast of Libya, with an estimated 116 migrants dead or missing and only a single survivor pulled from the water. The opposition press is framing this as a &quot;Christmas Eve soaked in blood,&quot; using it to attack the government’s deterrence strategy right as families sit down for dinner. The Right-wing press, however, looks straight past the tragedy to the culprits. *La Verità* runs a scathing headline suggesting that, in the eyes of the Left, smugglers are &quot;heroes,&quot; while *Il Giornale* focuses its coverage on the &quot;pardoning&quot; of a smuggler by President Mattarella yesterday. Two completely different realities, separated by a stretch of sea.
**SECTION 2: THE ROUNDUP**
Moving from the coast to the countryside, we turn to a story that has unexpectedly become a ferocious cultural battleground: the case of the &quot;Family in the Woods.&quot;
As you may recall from social media, a Finnish-German couple living a primitive, &quot;off-grid&quot; lifestyle in the Italian woods had their children removed by the state. Today, the courts granted the father a two-hour supervised Christmas visit, but also ordered a psychiatric evaluation for the parents. The reaction is polarized. *Il Post* provides the cool-headed explainer, noting the children were found in hygienic conditions that alarmed social services. However, the hard Right has adopted this family as martyrs of state overreach. *La Verità* and *Libero* are furious, calling the psychiatric order a &quot;poisoned Christmas gift&quot; from the judges and quoting League leader Matteo Salvini, who calls the separation of the family &quot;shameful.&quot; It is a classic Italian standoff: the cold bureaucracy of the law versus the sacred, untouchable nature of the traditional family unit.
Turning to the symbolic, Premier Giorgia Meloni has opened another front in the &quot;identity wars,&quot; this time involving the Nativity scene.
Following yesterday’s controversy over the National Anthem, Meloni released a video message explicitly defending the *Presepe* as a symbol of &quot;national roots&quot; rather than just religious faith. *Libero Quotidiano* cheers this as the &quot;Revolution of the Presepe,&quot; framing it as an act of defiance against a &quot;woke&quot; culture that wants to erase tradition—citing a Santa Claus deemed &quot;too white&quot; as their latest grievance. *Corriere della Sera*, playing the adult in the room, simply notes that for the Right, the Nativity has become a political flag to be planted. In Italy, even the Baby Jesus is subject to a parliamentary split.
**SECTION 3: THE WRAP-UP**
But before we go to our Christmas dinners, here is a final rapid-fire scan of the newsstand:
First, a classic Neapolitan crime story. *ANSA* and *AGI* report the arrest of Ciro Andolfi, one of Italy's 100 most dangerous fugitives. The Camorra boss was finally captured after three years on the run. Where was he? Hiding in a secret bunker constructed behind a radiator in his own home. Some traditions never die.
Also, a geopolitical snub that is making waves. *Corriere* reports that former EU Commissioner Thierry Breton—a frequent critic of Elon Musk—was denied a visa to enter the United States. While Brussels calls it &quot;unacceptable,&quot; *Il Fatto Quotidiano* highlights that Matteo Salvini’s Lega is siding with the Americans, essentially saying: &quot;Their house, their rules.&quot;
And finally, the ultimate act of political cynicism. *La Verità* and *Libero* are having a field day with the news that Aboubakar Soumahoro—the MP who entered parliament wearing muddy boots to represent migrant workers, before being engulfed in a family scandal—is reportedly making eyes at the Center-Right for a future candidacy. If true, it would be the most spectacular &quot;cambio di casacca&quot;—or coat-turning—of the legislature.
That is the state of the country today. Merry Christmas, Buon Natale, and I will see you on Friday.</description>

      <description>**ITALY TODAY**
Welcome, I am your host Amelia. Today is Thursday, December 25. Today's episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.
**SECTION 1: THE LEAD**
We begin with a Christmas that is less about peace and joy, and more about sirens and sandbags. While the lights are twinkling in Rome, the reality in Emilia-Romagna remains critical. Following up on yesterday’s report regarding the &quot;polar vortex,&quot; the situation has escalated into a full-blown emergency.
*Il Sole 24 Ore* and *Corriere della Sera* confirm that the &quot;Red Alert&quot; is active today. In the Ravenna area, specifically around the Senio river, the holidays have been suspended: evacuations have been ordered as water levels threaten to breach the banks yet again. While families across Italy were sitting down for lunch, civil protection units were deploying across the mud-soaked plains of the north. It is a bitter sense of déjà vu for a region that has spent too much of the last two years underwater.
Meanwhile, in the Vatican, the new Pontiff, Leone XIV, delivered his first &quot;Urbi et Orbi&quot; blessing, and the tone was far from festive. The Pope did not mince words. *Corriere della Sera* highlights his explicit condemnation of the &quot;distorted economy&quot; that treats humans as merchandise and acts as a catalyst for war. He specifically called for direct dialogue between Moscow and Kyiv to end the slaughter. The reactions, naturally, are split. While the mainstream press focuses on his spiritual appeal for peace, *Libero Quotidiano* frames it as a &quot;strigliata&quot;—a scolding—where the Pope essentially told the Church and the world to stop focusing on the &quot;market&quot; of Christmas and look at the &quot;tents of Gaza.&quot;
**SECTION 2: THE ROUNDUP**
Moving from the floods to the forests, we return to the culture war of the week: the &quot;Family in the Woods.&quot;
As we noted yesterday, the case of the Finnish-German family living off-grid whose children were seized by the state has become a major flashpoint. *La Repubblica* reports a bittersweet development today: the father was granted a &quot;lightning visit&quot; with his children for Christmas. However, it was strictly controlled—a supervised encounter that notably did not include Christmas lunch. This bureaucratic strictness has enraged the Right. *Libero Quotidiano* and *Il Giornale* are amplifying the fury of Matteo Salvini, who called the decision &quot;shameful&quot; and a &quot;violence of the State,&quot; arguing that denying a family a meal together on December 25th is an act of cruelty, regardless of the parents' lifestyle choices.
Turning our attention south, the festivities in Naples were marred by a tragedy that feels depressingly familiar.
While the rest of the country was unwrapping gifts, *Fanpage* and *Il Giornale* report that a seven-year-old boy was shot and wounded in Naples on Christmas Eve. The initial reconstruction suggests the child was hit by a stray bullet fired during &quot;celebratory&quot; shooting—a dangerous local &quot;tradition&quot; that authorities struggle to eradicate. He is currently hospitalized at the Santobono hospital. For the Right-wing press, this is evidence of lawlessness in the South; for the local papers, it is a heartbreaking reminder that in some neighborhoods, the line between celebration and crime is non-existent.
**SECTION 3: THE WRAP-UP**
But before we go, here is a rapid-fire scan of the rest of the newsstand:
First, a dose of nostalgia. *Il Post* and *Corriere* report the death of Paolo Bontempi at the age of 83. If you grew up in Italy—or anywhere in Europe—in the last forty years, you likely owned one of his small, orange chaotic electric keyboards. He was the man who put a synthesizer in every child's bedroom.
Also, the geopolitics of well-wishing. *Corriere* notes that Vladimir Putin sent Christmas greetings to Donald Trump and Viktor Orbán, but conspicuously ignored the leaders of &quot;unfriendly&quot; nations. Meanwhile, *Libero* seizes on a darker headline from Kyiv, where President Zelensky, in his speech, evoked a &quot;dream&quot; that everyone shares—implying the death of the Russian leader.
And finally, a grim statistic that the Italian press seems obsessed with today. Almost every major paper, from *Adnkronos* to *La Stampa*, is reporting multiple incidents of people choking to death on Panettone or fruit during Christmas Eve dinners. It is a macabre detail to focus on, but perhaps fitting for a news cycle that—even on Christmas—refuses to look away from the darker side of life.
That is the state of the country today. Merry Christmas, Buon Natale, and I will see you tomorrow.</description>

      <link>https://briefings.my/italy-today/artifacts/2025-12-26/2025-12-26-audio.mp3</link>
      <description>[energetic] Welcome to another episode of &quot;Italy Today&quot;, I am your host Amelia, Today is Friday 26 and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.
&lt;break time=&quot;1.0s&quot; /&gt;
[somber] We begin tonight with the lowering of a flag in Turin, marking the definitive end of the Twentieth Century for Italian industry. Maria Sole Agnelli, the sister of the legendary &quot;Avvocato&quot; Gianni Agnelli, has died at the age of 100. While her brother was the flamboyant king of Italy’s post-war economic boom, Maria Sole was the picture of Piedmontese discretion, a trait that the Italian press is mourning deeply today. *La Stampa*, the newspaper historically owned by the Agnelli family, treats this almost as a royal funeral, describing her as the keeper of the family's &quot;genetic memory&quot; and a woman of quiet, steel resolve who steered the family foundation through decades of turbulence.
[newscaster] However, even in death, the fractures in the dynasty are visible. While *Corriere della Sera* and *La Repubblica* focus on her role as a patron of the extraordinary and her grim sadness at outliving her brothers, the Right-wing press is looking at the ruins left behind. *Libero* takes a sharper angle, juxtaposing her dignified passing with what it calls the &quot;Year of Horrors&quot; for her nephew, John Elkann, citing the bitter inheritance battles and the industrial decline of the former Fiat empire. The takeaway across the board is clear: a generation of style and silence has passed, leaving behind a much noisier, and perhaps less capable, group of heirs.
&lt;break time=&quot;1.0s&quot; /&gt;
[newscaster] Moving from the history books to the war room, the diplomatic ground is shifting rapidly underneath Europe's feet. *Corriere della Sera* confirms that President Zelensky will meet Donald Trump this Sunday at Mar-a-Lago, a high-stakes summit that will involve European leaders dialing in remotely. This is the moment Rome and Brussels have been waiting for—or fearing.
[cynical] But if you want to understand the narrative battle, you have to look at how the conservative press is framing the run-up to this meeting. *Il Giornale*, always close to the institutional Right, runs a headline suggesting that Moscow is &quot;ready for a deal,&quot; but claims that &quot;Kyiv and Europe are trying to sink it.&quot; This is a significant pivot, painting the EU—not Russia—as the obstacle to peace. Meanwhile, the Vatican continues to sound the alarm on the moral cost of this conflict. following up on his Christmas message, Pope Leone XIV spoke at the Angelus today, with *Fanpage* noting his bitter observation that those who believe in peace today are &quot;ridiculed and expelled from public discourse.&quot; The divide is stark: the Atlanticists are preparing for a negotiation in Florida, while the Populists are already blaming Europe if it fails.
&lt;break time=&quot;1.0s&quot; /&gt;
[cynical] Turning our attention to domestic politics, we have a story that proves the oldest rule in Italian bureaucracy: nothing costs as much as trying to save money. Remember the &quot;Taglio dei Parlamentari&quot;? That massive populist victory led by the Five Star Movement to slash the number of MPs and save the taxpayers millions?
[newscaster] Well, the bill has arrived, and the math does not add up. *La Repubblica* and *Adnkronos* report that despite cutting the number of deputies and senators, the operating costs of the Chamber have actually *increased*. *Corriere della Sera* breaks down the numbers, showing that the savings on salaries were instantly swallowed up by increases in bureaucratic overhead and pensions. The opposition is furious, but the irony is palpable. As *Il Fatto Quotidiano* attempts to defend the measure by arguing the costs would have been &quot;even higher&quot; without the cut, the general public is left with the realization that in Rome, the house always wins, and the budget never shrinks.
&lt;break time=&quot;1.0s&quot; /&gt;
[energetic] But before we go, here is a quick scan of the rest of the newsstand.
[newscaster] First, a follow-up on yesterday’s weather emergency. *Il Sole Ventiquattro Ore* reports a slight reprieve for Emilia-Romagna. The &quot;Red Alert&quot; has been downgraded to orange in many areas, and evacuees in Ravenna are beginning to return to their homes as the floodwaters recede, though the region remains on high guard.
[energetic] Also, if you thought everyone spent Christmas arguing over politics, the box office says otherwise. *Ansa* reports a record-breaking debut for comedian Checco Zalone’s new film &quot;Buen Camino,&quot; which raked in 5.6 million euros in a single day. It is a staggering number that confirms Zalone remains the only person in Italy capable of uniting the North and South in laughter.
[somber] And finally, a note of alarm from across the border. *La Repubblica* and *Il Giornale* are both covering a violent knife attack in the Paris Metro today where three women were wounded. While authorities have ruled out terrorism for now, the incident has dominated the Italian news cycle, playing into existing anxieties about safety in European transit hubs.
[newscaster] That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.</description>

      <description>[energetic] Welcome to another episode of &quot;Italy Today&quot;, I am your host Amelia, Today is Saturday 27 and this episode was curated by Gemini 3 Pro.
&lt;break time=&quot;1.0s&quot; /&gt;
[newscaster] We open tonight with a story that has ignited a firestorm across the Italian political spectrum, blurring the lines between humanitarian aid and terrorism financing. In a major operation coordinated by the Genoa prosecutor's office, police have arrested nine people accused of funneling money to Hamas. According to *Corriere della Sera* and *Il Sole Ventiquattro Ore*, the network allegedly transferred over seven million euros under the guise of &quot;Charity for Gaza.&quot; The central figure in this investigation is Mohammad Hannoun, an architect based in Genoa who was already on a U.S. blacklist, but who had operated relatively openly in Italy until now.
[cynical] The reaction to these arrests has been instantaneous and polarized. *Il Giornale* and the right-wing press are taking a victory lap, running headlines that connect Hannoun to prominent figures on the Left, specifically mentioning photos of him with former bold-faced names of the Democratic Party and highlighting his proximity to UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese. They view this as vindication that the &quot;Free Palestine&quot; movement in Italy has been infiltrated by bad actors. On the other side of the aisle, *Fanpage* and *Il Fatto Quotidiano* provide the defense, quoting Hannoun’s lawyers and supporters who argue that &quot;solidarity is being criminalized&quot; and insisting that the funds were purely for humanitarian relief in a war zone. Prime Minister Meloni, however, has wasted no time, expressing her &quot;satisfaction&quot; with the operation, signaling that the government intends to take a hard line on where this money is going.

[newscaster] Moving from the courts of Genoa to the halls of the Senate, the government has passed a controversial reform that fundamentally changes how public money is monitored. The Senate has given the definitive green light to the reform of the &quot;Corte dei Conti,&quot; the Court of Auditors. essentially, this law limits the liability of public administrators for &quot;grave negligence.&quot;
[cynical] The split in the coverage tells you exactly what is at stake. *Il Sole Ventiquattro Ore*, usually the voice of business and pragmatism, simply notes that it is now law. But *Il Fatto Quotidiano* is screaming from the rooftops, quoting magistrates who call this a &quot;dark page&quot; for the republic, arguing that it weakens the responsibility of politicians handling taxpayers' money. *Fanpage* echoes this, suggesting there will now be fewer controls on political spending. The government's defense, supported by *Libero*, is that this will end &quot;bureaucratic fear&quot;—the idea that mayors and officials are too scared of lawsuits to actually sign off on infrastructure projects.

[somber] Turning our gaze internationally, following up on yesterday's report regarding the upcoming peace talks, the price tag for the future of Ukraine is coming into focus, and it is staggering. *Corriere della Sera* reports from President Zelensky’s trip to Canada, where he stated that rebuilding his country will require 800 billion dollars. However, the backdrop to this request is grim. While Russian drones and missiles struck high-rises in Kyiv last night, plunging a million people into darkness, *Adnkronos* reports a new corruption scandal shaking the Ukrainian parliament involving deputies selling votes. It is a dual narrative that the Italian press is struggling to reconcile: the desperate need for aid against the reality of internal graft.
&lt;break time=&quot;1.0s&quot; /&gt;
[energetic] But before we go, here is a quick scan of the rest of the newsstand.
[somber] First, a disturbing report from the south. *Corriere della Sera* and *Libero* are covering a brutal attack in the province of Salerno, where a local Mayor, Carmine Siano, was beaten with a baton outside his home by a hooded assailant. He has suffered fractures and the amputation of a finger. It is a stark reminder of the physical risks local administrators still face in certain parts of the country.
[newscaster] Also, nature is putting on a show in Sicily. *AGI* and *La Repubblica* report that Mount Etna has surged back into activity, spitting fountains of lava up to 400 meters high. The airport in Catania is on alert, but for now, the spectacle remains a visual one rather than a logistical nightmare.
[cynical] And finally, because no Italian news cycle is complete without a celebrity real estate feud, *Il Fatto Quotidiano* and *Libero* are relishing a dispute involving singer Eros Ramazzotti. His neighbor in Milan has sued him for 200,000 euros, claiming that renovations in the singer's apartment caused the neighbor's ceiling to collapse. Ramazzotti’s team calls the version &quot;incomplete,&quot; but the press is enjoying the domestic drama of a superstar dealing with the same condominium headaches as everyone else.
[newscaster] That is the state of the country today. I will see you tomorrow.</description>

Let’s get straight to the pulse of the nation. The tragedy in Anguillara has spiraled into horror as the parents of Claudio Carlomagno—the man who confessed to killing his wife—were found dead by suicide, crushed, as **Corriere della Sera** reports, by a mix of shame and social media pillorying. On the diplomatic calendar, today marks ten years since the disappearance of Giulio...</div>

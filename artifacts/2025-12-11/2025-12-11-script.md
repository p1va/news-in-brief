I am your host Amelia, today is Thursday 11, and this is 'Asia in Brief'. Today's episode is brought to you by DeepSeek-V3.2-Special, let's get into it!

**"90km Inside"**  
Thai F-16s have struck up to 90 kilometers inside Cambodia, marking a major escalation in the five-day border conflict. According to Cambodia’s interior ministry, the raids hit civilian areas, raising the death toll to 11 with 74 wounded and displacing nearly 190,000 people. Phnom Penh announced it will file a war crimes complaint at the International Criminal Court, accusing Bangkok of targeting cultural sites and non-combatants. Thailand insists it is responding to Cambodian rocket attacks and says its drones are operated by foreign actors. The fighting risks drawing in outside powers and could fracture ASEAN’s already fragile unity.

**"US Backs Japan"**  
The United States has publicly sided with Japan in its escalating dispute with China over a radar-locking incident in the East China Sea. Washington called Beijing’s actions “provocative” and reaffirmed its security commitments to Tokyo. Japan maintains it received no prior warning before Chinese jets locked onto its aircraft, while China claims its drills were routine and accuses Japan of interference. The diplomatic chill has spilled into culture: a planned exhibition by Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki was abruptly canceled in China. Analysts say President Trump faces a dilemma—balancing alliance loyalty with his desire for a reset with Beijing—as the standoff threatens $500 billion in bilateral trade.

**"Putin Courts Prabowo"**  
Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted Indonesian leader Prabowo Subianto in Moscow on Wednesday, discussing expanded military cooperation, energy deals, and wheat exports. The meeting signals Russia’s push to strengthen ties with major non-aligned economies amid Western isolation. Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country, has traditionally balanced relations with the US and China. Closer Jakarta-Moscow ties could give Russia a foothold in Southeast Asia and complicate Western efforts to contain its influence, while also offering Indonesia alternative sources of grain and arms as global food insecurity rises.
